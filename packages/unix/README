Welcome to Open Dylan!
======================

Open Dylan is an open source implementation of the Dylan programming
language, plus a large number of assorted libraries.

This release is Open Dylan 2013.2. We expect this release to have bugs.
We're interested in getting your feedback, in order to improve this product.
Write to hackers@opendylan.org or report a bug via GitHub
(https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues). We can also help via IRC,
just drop by on irc.freenode.net in channel #dylan .


Requirements
============

This tarball contains the port of Open Dylan to UNIX on x86 CPUs.  So,
you should have that, or an emulation thereof, to run this distribution.
More specifically, due to the usage of thread-local storage, the
minimum requirements are:

FreeBSD:
 * FreeBSD 9

Linux:
 * Linux kernel 2.6
 * glibc 2.3

Mac OS X:
 * Lion
 * XCode 4.2.1


Installation
============

This tarball is set up to be extracted in /opt, resulting in the
creation of a directory /opt/opendylan-2013.2.  You just have to add
/opt/opendylan-2013.2/bin to your PATH:

  $ export PATH=/opt/opendylan-2013.2/bin:$PATH    # for bash

or

  $ setenv PATH /opt/opendylan-2013.2/bin:$PATH    # for tcsh


Usage
=====

If you are new to the compiler, the Getting Started with the
Command Line Tools is recommended:
