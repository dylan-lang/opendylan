    <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.
  * Symlink points to current installed version of packages, for easier tooling.

  Full documentation is
  `here <https://docs.opendylan.org/packages/dylan-tool/documentation/source/index.html>`_.

  :command:`dylan new application` and :command:`dylan new library`.


Library Updates
===============

Submodules
----------

Open Dylan uses Git submodules to pull in some dependencies and user programs
may depend on these for now. The notable changes in those submodules are listed
below:

* **sphinx-extensions** - Improvements to DRM references.

* **dylan-tool** - See above.

* **collection-extensions** - The ``split-at`` function has been removed. Use
  :gf:`split` instead. Documentation improvements.

* **command-line-parser** - Minor bug fix to add a missing newline when no
  subcommand is provided.

* **json** - Fixed ``sort-keys?`` option for recursive :gf:`print-json` calls.


system Library
--------------

* A `bug <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1470>`_ in
  :func:`locator-directory` for relative directory locators was fixed.

* The :func:`run-application` function is now fully documented.

* A ``follow-links?:`` keyword argument has been added to the
  :func:`file-exists?` function. The default is true, for compatibility with the
  previous behavior.
