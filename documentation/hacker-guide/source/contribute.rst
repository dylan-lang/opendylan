*******************************

Please read our `public guidelines
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_
for contributing.

Getting the Sources
===================

The first thing you'll need to start contributing is a source checkout
of the Git repository.  The `Open Dylan sources
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan>`_ are hosted on GitHub,
along with sources for the `opendylan.org web site
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/website>`_ and various other
repositories.  If you don't yet have a GitHub account and ssh keys,
now is a good time to get them.

To checkout the main "opendylan" repository::

    git clone git@github.com:dylan-lang/opendylan.git

You will want to fork this repository so you can push changes to your
fork and then submit pull requests.
