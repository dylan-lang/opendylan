Documentation Improvements
==========================

LID file keywords are better documented in the Library Reference.

The strings library has been documented in the Library Reference.


Portability Enhancements
========================

The configure script could fail on Gentoo Linux as there was not always
a static ``libgc.a`` available. We now check for the file that we need
on each platform.

Runtime Improvements
====================

The C run-time no longer attempts to drop into a debugger if you allocate
more than roughly 100M of memory in a single allocation.

Library Improvements
====================

collections
-----------

The ``collections`` library now exports a ``collections`` convenience
module that re-exports the ``set``, ``bit-set``, ``bit-vector`` and
``byte-vector`` modules. This simplifies using the additional collection
types from within other libraries and applications.

Windows Support
===============

The 2012.1 release introduced a bug with where settings were
stored in the Windows registry. This has been corrected.
