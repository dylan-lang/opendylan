Improvements
============

Documentation
-------------

LID file keywords are better documented in the Library Reference.

The strings library has been documented in the Library Reference.


Portability
-----------

The configure script could fail on Gentoo Linux as there was not always
a static ``libgc.a`` available. We now check for the file that we need
on each platform.

Runtime
-------

The C run-time no longer attempts to drop into a debugger if you allocate
more than roughly 100M of memory in a single allocation.

Libraries
---------

collections
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``collections`` library now exports a ``collections`` convenience
module that re-exports the ``set``, ``bit-set``, ``bit-vector`` and
``byte-vector`` modules. This simplifies using the additional collection
types from within other libraries and applications.

Bug Fixes
=========

Windows Support
---------------

The 2012.1 release introduced a bug with where settings were
stored in the Windows registry. This has been corrected.

The Windows installer for Open Dylan now defaults to suggesting the
Pelles C tools rather than Visual C 6. This is the start of improving
the new user experience on Windows and having it work out of the
box.

Build Tools
-----------

Directories listed in the shell environment variable
OPEN_DYLAN_USER_REGISTRIES now take precedence over the ./registry
directory, if any.

Warnings are now formatted in more standard way so that tools like
Emacs can parse them, for example to jump to the source of the next
error.
