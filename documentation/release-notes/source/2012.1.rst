What's New?
===========

Documentation Improvements
--------------------------

* All documentation has been converted to the Sphinx document
  generator.  This is a huge improvement in our ability to keep the
  documentation up-to-date, modernizes its look and feel, and allows
  us to generate various output formats.

* The core libraries documentation has been unified into one `Dylan
  Library Reference
  <http://opendylan.org/documentation/library-reference/index.html>`_
  document.

* The documentation on using the Open Dylan Console Environment has
  been rewritten and expanded.  A new section on the Dylan Interaction
  Mode for Emacs (DIME) has been added.  See both in `the Getting
  Started Guide
  <http://opendylan.org/documentation/getting-started/index.html>`_.


C3 Superclass Linearization
---------------------------

Open Dylan now uses the C3 superclass linearization algorithm.  This
algorithm was originally designed for Dylan but for historical reasons
was never implemented in Dylan, until now.  In most cases this change
should not change the semantics of existing programs, but if it does
the compiler will issue a serious warning.  In a future release this
will be changed to non-serious warning, and then eventually the
warning will be removed completely.

.. TODO: add example of the warning?

See `DEP-0003 <http://opendylan.org/proposals/dep-0003.html>`_ for
more details.


Multi-threading for the C Back-end
----------------------------------

The C back-end now fully supports multi-threading.  Several bugs
unrelated to threading were also fixed in this work, which should
improve the stability of the C back-end in general.

.. TODO: moar details



Other Changes
-------------

.. TODO: elevate more of these to their own section.
