Improvements
============

Documentation
-------------

The `regular-expressions <http://opendylan.org/documentation/library-reference/regular-expressions/index.html>`_ library documentation has been greatly improved.

Libraries
---------

I/O
^^^

A function ``stream-console?`` has been added to the ``<file-stream>`` class,
this can be used to determine whether console output has been directed to a
file.

network
^^^^^^^

The bindings ``$local-host`` and ``$loopback-address`` are removed. The function ``local-host-name`` is now provided which returns the host name.
The main reason for this change was ongoing confusion by the way the network library initialized itself (calling ``gethostname`` and passing its result to ``gethostbyname``, which does not work on all computers).
