Open Dylan 2025.1
*****************

This document describes the 2025.1 release of Open Dylan, released 21
June, 2025.  The highlights of the release are listed below.  For complete
details see the `commit logs
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/compare/v2024.1.0...v2025.1.0>`_ for
this release.

.. note:: Some commit logs, for example for testworks and other libraries that
          are included in Open Dylan as git submodules, may be in other
          repositories.

Compiler
========

* Unified executables now export symbols so that call stack dumping
  works properly.

* The build rules for unified executables now properly depend on
  copying included run-time libraries such as libunwind.

* Optimizations that allow the type of :drm:`if` expressions to be more
  accurately estimated have been improved. For example, in this
  function:

  .. code-block::

    define function if-example (arg :: false-or(<integer>)) => (result :: <integer>);
      min(arg | 20, 30)
    end;

  the comparison can now be properly inlined because the first
  argument to :drm:`min` is known to be an :drm:`<integer>`.

* `Issue 1523 <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1523>`_, which
  could result in a compiler abort during code generation, has been fixed.

* A `serious bug <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1624>`_ in the parsing
  of multi-line string literals has been fixed.

* `Issue 1647 <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1647>`_,
  which suppressed error reporting within macro calls in slot
  initializer expressions, is now fixed.

* `Issue 1660 <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1660>`_,
  which caused code generation failures for certain usages of
  multiple-value expressions, has been fixed.

* Fixed `issue 1395 <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1395>`_, which
  prevented some valid variable names with a leading numeric from being parsed correctly.

* A bug in the LLVM back-end that could cause stack overflows in
  long-running functions that capture closures (such as for
  exception handlers) has been fixed.

Tools
=====

* A new binary, ``dylan-lsp-server``, is bundled in this release. This is a
  Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for use with VS Code and
  emacs. It currently supports jump to definition/declaration, compiler
  warnings, and hover text.

  See the `lsp-server documentation
  <https://package.opendylan.org/lsp-dylan/>`_ for configuration details.

* The ``dylan`` tool has been renamed to `deft
  <https://package.opendylan.org/deft/>`_.  This was done primarily because it
  avoids some awkwardness when having to distinguish between the Dylan language
  and the ``dylan`` tool. The ``dylan`` binary continues to exist for backward
  compatibility (for example in GitHub workflows) but it will be removed in a
  future release.

  A new command, `deft test <https://package.opendylan.org/deft/index.html#deft-test>`_,
  has been added to run tests defined in your workspace. See the `Deft 0.13.0 release
  notes <https://github.com/dylan-lang/deft/releases/tag/v0.13.0>`_ for a list of other
  Deft changes.

Library Updates
===============

collections
-----------

* The ``collections`` convenience module, which re-exported names from some (but not all)
  other modules in the ``collections`` library, has been removed as unnecessary
  complexity.

* The ``collectors`` module is now `fully documented
  <https://opendylan.org/library-reference/collections/collectors.html>`_, the API has
  been made more consistent, and a bug in :drm:`<list>` collectors has been fixed. See
  `the pull request <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/pull/1627>`_ for details.

Dylan
-----

* The return value of :drm:`push-last` on :drm:`<deque>` now matches
  that specified in the Dylan Reference Manual.

IO
----

* The performance of several subclasses of :class:`<wrapper-stream>`
  has been improved by sealing the :func:`inner-stream` method for
  each subclass.

System
------

* The :const:`$machine-name` constant has been renamed to
  :const:`$machine-architecture`.  The old name will remain, for backward
  compatibility.

* Add new functions :func:`create-symbolic-link` and
  :func:`create-hard-link` to the module ``file-system``. Windows is
  not yet supported.

Other
-----

* The :lib:`dispatch-profiler` library is now usable and is
  documented.

* The obsolete (32-bit x86-only) ``stack-walker`` library was removed.
