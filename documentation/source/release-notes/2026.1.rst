Open Dylan 2026.1
*****************

This document describes the 2026.1 release of Open Dylan, released February 2026.  The
highlights of the release are listed below.  For complete details see the `commit logs
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/compare/v2025.1.0...v2026.1.0>`_ for this
release.

Compiler
========

* The compiler no longer copies C/C++ source files, C/C++ header
  files, C object files, Windows resource files, and Jam include files
  into the build directory before performing the link build stage, and
  instead makes the original source directory location available to
  the build system (and the Jam build scripts).

* The compiler now signals an error when it is not able to inline a
  call to a method that has either a method parameter or a return
  value with a raw type. This provides explicit guidance when
  encountering the situation outlined in `Issue 1377
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1377>`_.

* Repeated optimization involving lifting closures to top level now
  properly preserves types of local bindings.

* Optimization of the type estimation of :drm:`if` expressions can now
  be repeated multiple times as the function is iteratively improved.

* The compiler now supports an extended version of
  ``copy-down-method-definer`` allowing a ``specializing`` clause
  selecting which of the more-general methods should be selected for
  inlining in the case of dispatch ambiguity. Additionally, ambiguous
  ``copy-down-method`` definitions are now signaled as serious
  warnings rather than allowing a random applicable method to be
  chosen for inlining.

* The overhead for critical runtime code used for type checking and
  method dispatch has been reduced by ensuring that certain object
  slots could never be considered uninitialized.

* The implementation of ``define thread variable`` has changed to
  improve the integration with the garbage collector, reducing the
  number of GC roots that need to be registered to one per thread,
  thus increasing the number of threads that can be run. (No
  significant change in execution performance is expected.)

* Debug information for functions with code spanning multiple source
  files is now handled properly, fixing `Issue 1777
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1777>`_.

IDE
===

* Paths for the example and test suite projects accessible from the
  :menuselection:`Tools --> Open Example Project...` dialog have been
  fixed.

Bundled Library Updates
=======================

Changes to libraries that are part of the `opendylan repository
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan>`_.

Dylan
-----

* A number of ``copy-down-method`` definitions in the :lib:`dylan` library that were
  previously marked as ambiguous have been corrected.  This removes the vast majority of
  the warnings that were generated during the initial build of a project due to
  recompiling the ``dylan`` library.

Common-Dylan
------------

* A problem with retrieving :func:`application-name` and
  :func:`application-arguments` results from the operating system when
  running Dylan applications under tools such as :program:`valgrind` has
  been fixed.

io
---

* Specific versions of the stream functions sealed on
  ``<byte-char-file-stream>`` and ``<byte-file-stream>`` are provided,
  significantly improving the performance of these stream operations.

System
------

* :gf:`resolve-file` (in the ``file-system`` module) replaces the deprecated
  :const:`resolve-locator` (in the ``locators`` module) because it is fundamentally a
  file-system operation.

  :gf:`resolve-file` now returns the correct class of locator, a subclass of
  :class:`<file-locator>` or class:`<directory-locator>`, depending on the actual file
  type of the fully resolved file.  It previously returned an instance of the same
  class as the locator it was provided, but that is not always accurate when symbolic
  links are followed.

* :gf:`directory-contents` has a new keyword argument ``resolve-links?``.  If true,
  symbolic links are resolved as with :gf:`resolve-file`.

* :gf:`expand-pathname` is no longer called by other ``file-system`` functions.  If you
  depended on this behavior, call :gf:`expand-pathname` directly.

  On Unix, ``~`` or ``~user`` are expanded to the specified user's home directory.  The
  exact string "~" is now correctly expanded.  :gf:`expand-pathname` now uses the thread
  safe function ``getpwnam_r`` on Unix systems.

  On Windows, 8.3 short file names are expanded.

* `Issue 1408 <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1408>`_, which could result
  in an infinite loop in :gf:`link-target`, has been fixed.  In addition, the
  :gf:`link-target` function accepts a new keyword argument, ``follow-links?``, which
  specifies whether to follow all links until a non-symlink file is found (the default)
  or just return the direct target of the given symlink.

Submoduled Library Updates
==========================

The following changes were made to Open Dylan dependencies that are included as Git
submodules.

* The logging library: `b0b469a -> v2.2.1
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/logging/compare/b0b469abc291a07312dbb8a4b1e57f55c31b8cba...v2.2.1>`_
* The strings library: `v2.0.0 -> v2.0.1
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/strings/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1>`_
* The testworks library: `v3.3.0 -> v3.4.0
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/testworks/compare/v3.3.0...v3.4.0>`_
* The ``dswank`` library (the back-end for the DIME Emacs-based IDE) and the `DIME
  documentation <https://package.opendylan.org/dylan-emacs-support>`_ have been moved to
  the `dylan-emacs-support repository
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-emacs-support>`_ so that they can be maintained in
  sync with the DIME Elisp code.  Several important bugs have been fixed for `v0.2.0
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-emacs-support/releases/tag/v0.2.0>`_, the version
  distributed with this release.
