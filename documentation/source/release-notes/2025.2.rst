System
------

* :gf:`resolve-locator` now returns the correct class of locator, :class:`<file-locator>`
  or :class:`<directory-locator>`, depending on the actual file type of the fully
  resolved locator.  It previously returned an instance of the same class as the locator
  it was provided, but that is not always accurate when symbolic links are followed.

* :gf:`directory-contents` has a new keyword argument ``resolve-links?``.  If true,
  symbolic links are resolved as with :gf:`resolve-locator`.  See the
  :gf:`directory-contents` documentation for caveats.
