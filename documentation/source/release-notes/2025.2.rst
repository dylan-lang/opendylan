Compiler
========

* The compiler no longer copies C/C++ source files, C/C++ header
  files, C object files, Windows resource files, and Jam include files
  into the build directory before performing the link build stage, and
  instead makes the original source directory location available to
  the build system (and the Jam build scripts).

* The compiler now signals an error when it is not able to inline a
  call to a method that has either a method parameter or a return
  value with a raw type. This provides explicit guidance when
  encountering the situation outlined in `Issue 1377
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1377>`_.
