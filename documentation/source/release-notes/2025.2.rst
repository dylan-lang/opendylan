System
------

* :gf:`resolve-file` (in the ``file-system`` module) replaces :const:`resolve-locator`
  (in the ``locators`` module) because it is fundamentally a file-system operation.

  :gf:`resolve-file` now returns the correct class of locator, a subclass of
  :class:`<file-locator>` or class:`<directory-locator>`, depending on the actual file
  type of the fully resolved file.  It previously returned an instance of the same
  class as the locator it was provided, but that is not always accurate when symbolic
  links are followed.

* :gf:`directory-contents` has a new keyword argument ``resolve-links?``.  If true,
  symbolic links are resolved as with :gf:`resolve-file`.
