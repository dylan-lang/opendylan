An Introduction to Dylan
########################

This document introduces the Dylan programming language. Dylan is an
object-oriented dynamic language designed for efficient
compilation. It uses an algebraic infix syntax similar to Pascal or C,
but supports an object model not unlike the Common Lisp Object System
(CLOS).

This tutorial is written primarily for those with solid
programming experience in C++ or another object-oriented static
language. It provides a gentler introduction to Dylan than does the
DRM, although it refers to the latter book frequently.
