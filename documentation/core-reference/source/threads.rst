*******************
The Threads Module
*******************

Introduction
============

The Threads module provides a portable threads interface for Dylan. The
Threads module is designed to map easily and efficiently onto the
threads facilities provided by all common operating systems.

All documented bindings are exported from the module *threads* in the
*dylan* library.

Multi-thread semantics
======================

The Threads module provides multiple threads of control within a single
space of objects and module variables. Each thread runs in its own
independent stack. The mechanism by which the threads are scheduled is
not specified, and it is not possible to determine how the execution of
instructions by different threads will be interleaved. No mechanism is
provided to call a function on an existing thread other than the current
thread. Neither is there a mechanism to signal an exception on a thread
other than the current thread.

Atomicity
---------

In general, the Threads module guarantees that assignments to slots and
variables are atomic. That is, after an assignment, but before
synchronization, another thread will see either the old value or the new
value of the location. There is no possibility of seeing a half-way
state.

In some circumstances, when a slot or a variable is specialized to be of
a particularly constrained type, the Threads module does not guarantee
atomicity of assignments. Such a type may include a subtype of
*<double-float>* or a subtype of *<extended-float>*. It may not include
any other type that is either defined in the current specification of
the Dylan language, or that could be created from standard facilities
provided by the current specification of the language. This restriction
of the atomicity guarantee is intended to permit implementations to
represent the values of such slots or variables in a form which uses
more space than a normal Dylan value, for optimal efficiency.

For those cases where the implementation does not provide the atomicity
guarantee, the results of accessing a normal variable are undefined if:

-  The read could proceed in parallel with some write of the same
   location
-  Two writes of the same location could have proceeded in parallel
   since the last non-parallel write

Two memory references *proceed in parallel* if they are not explicitly
sequentialized, either by being in a single thread, or by explicit
inter-thread synchronization.

Programmers should guard against the possibility of undefined values by
using explicit inter-thread synchronization.

Ordering
--------

The ordering of visibility of side effects performed in other threads is
undefined, unless explicit synchronization is used. Implementations of
the module may guarantee that the visibility of side-effects performed
by another thread is ordered according to the control flow of the other
thread (*strong ordering*), but multi-processor implementations might
not be strongly ordered. Portable code should not assume strong
ordering, and should use explicit synchronization where the order of
side effects is important. There is currently no module introspection
facility to determine if the implementation is strongly or weakly
ordered.

Because of the possibility of weak ordering, the compiler is free to
assume that the effects of other threads may be ignored between explicit
synchronization points, and it may perform any optimizations which
preserve the semantics of a single-thread model regardless of their
effects on other threads — for example, common sub-expression
elimination, or changing the order of evaluation.

Explicit synchronization
------------------------

The Threads module provides low-level synchronization functions which
control the ordering of operations with respect to other threads, and
control when the side effects that have been performed within one thread
become visible within other threads.

At a higher level, the Threads module provides a variety of
synchronization facilities, described below. These facilities include
mutual-exclusion locks, semaphores and notifications. Each facility
guarantees that when synchronization has been achieved, all the side
effects of another thread are visible, at least up to the point where
that other thread last released the synchronization facility.

An appropriate synchronization must be used to guard side-effects on
state if there is any possibility of those side-effects either being
corrupted by another thread or corrupting another thread. For example, a
function which assigns to two slots of an object may require the use of
a lock to guarantee that other threads never observe the object in a
partly updated state.

It is up to module designers to document when synchronization is not
performed internally, and when synchronization protocols must be used by
clients. The implications for the Dylan library, and some other
low-level libraries, are discussed in `Thread safety in client
libraries`_.

Conditional update
------------------

In addition to the synchronization primitives, the module provides a
conditional update mechanism which is not synchronized, but which tests
whether the value in a variable or slot has changed and atomically
updates it if not.

By using conditional updates, a thread can confirm (or deny) that there
has been no interference from other threads, without any need for a
blocking operation. This is more efficient for those circumstances where
interference is not disastrous and it is possible to recompute the
update.

For example, a function which increments the value of a variable might
use a conditional update to store the new value into place, in order to
guarantee a numeric sequence for the variable. In this example, the
function might loop until the conditional update has succeeded.

It is possible to achieve synchronization by looping until a conditional
update is successful, and then synchronizing side effects. This is not
recommended, because the busy-waiting state during the loop may disallow
other threads from running. Normally, conditional update should be used
only when it is expected to succeed. If it is likely that the
conditional update might fail multiple times around the loop, then
either the number of times around the loop should be limited, or a
blocking function from the Threads module should be used within the
loop.

The dynamic environment
-----------------------

Dylan has an implicit notion of a *dynamic environment*, corresponding
to language constructs with *dynamic extent*. For example, the *block*
construct can introduce *cleanup-clauses*, and the *body* of the block
is executed in a dynamic environment in which those cleanup-clauses are
active. *Handlers* and *exit procedures* are other examples of language
features related to the dynamic environment.

The dynamic environment is defined to be thread-local. When a new thread
is created, it starts with a fresh dynamic environment. It is an error
to attempt to use a handler or a non-local exit function belonging to
another thread. It is impossible to use an unwind-protect cleanup from
another thread.

Although the binding of condition handlers only affects the dynamic
environment of the current thread, unhandled conditions are passed to
the global generic function *default-handler*. This function might
*call the debugger*. The Threads module does not define what calling
the debugger means.

Note that in Dylan, unlike in C and C++, *lexical* variables (that is
local, or *let* -bound variables) have indefinite extent — that is, have
a lifetime independent of the function or block in which they were
created — and are not bound in the dynamic environment. Because those
variables are in general potentially global, you may need to explicitly
synchronize accesses to them.

Thread variables
----------------

The Threads module provides a new type of variable: a *thread*
variable, also known as a *thread-local* variable. These variables are
similar to normal module variables in the sense that they are visible
according to the same scoping rules and have the same semantics in a
single-threaded program. However, in contrast to a normal variable,
assignments to a thread variable in one thread are not visible when
evaluating the variable in another thread.

Whenever a thread is created, the value of each thread variable is
initialized to a thread-independent value resulting from a once-only
evaluation of the initialization expression of the thread variable
definition.

See page `thread`_ for details of the *thread* adjective to
*define variable*.

Dynamic binding
---------------

The Threads module exports a macro for dynamic binding. A *binding* is
a mapping between a variable and a*value-cell* which holds the
variable’s value. A *dynamic* binding is a binding which has dynamic
extent, and shadows any outermost bindings. Dynamic bindings can be
considered to be a property of the dynamic environment.

Thread variables can have new dynamic bindings created for them with the
macro `dynamic-bind`_. Thread variables inherently have thread-local
bindings, so it is possible to re-bind a thread variable dynamically
using the Dylan construct *block* … *cleanup*. The `dynamic-bind`_
macro can be implemented in this way.

The thread-local nature of dynamically bindable variables may not be
optimal for all problem domains. For instance a shared, global,
outermost binding may be desirable, or alternatively, a thread may want
to inherit current bindings from the parent thread at creation time,
giving a “fork”-type model of state inheritance. These alternatives are
not pursued in this module, but they might be an interesting area for
future research.

Thread safety in client libraries
=================================

If an application uses multiple threads, then there may be thread safety
requirements for any library that can be called simultaneously by
multiple threads, even if the called library does not use the Threads
library directly.

This section is about thread safety in any library that is designed to
be used in a multi-threaded application.

General requirements
--------------------

A library’s designer is responsible for documenting which features of
the library offer built-in synchronization and which do not. While there
is no definitive rule that can assist designers in this documentation,
the following guidelines may be useful.

If a client of the library forgets to use a synchronization feature when
one is necessary, the library designer should ensure that the effect of
the lack of synchronization is limited to a small unit — probably a
single object. In cases where the designer cannot guarantee that the
effect will be limited, the library should either implement the
synchronization internally, or provide a macro for clients to use
instead.

Library implementors must ensure that the library provides implicit
synchronization for any hidden global state which is maintained by the
library. Library designers may choose whether the library should offer
implicit synchronization of the state of objects managed by the library.
The interface is more convenient if the synchronization is implicit, but
it may be more efficient to rely on explicit synchronization by the
client. Library designers should always document the choice they make.

Effects on the Dylan library
----------------------------

The definition of the Dylan library is not changed with the addition of
the Threads module. The implementation ensures that all hidden global
state (such as the symbol table and any generic function caches) is
implicitly synchronized. Those functions in the Dylan library which are
defined to modify the state of objects are not defined to provide
implicit synchronization. However, implementations are expected to
ensure that synchronization bugs in Dylan programs will not cause
obscure errors that cannot be explained in terms of the semantics of
Dylan language constructs.

The library guarantees that *element* and *element-setter* will be
atomic for all of Dylan’s non-stretchy built-in collection classes, and
for *<table>*, except for subclasses of *<string>*, and limited
collections where the elements are constrained to be either of a type
for which slots and variables do not guarantee atomicity (see
`Atomicity`_) or a subtype of *<character>*, or of a proper subtype of
*<integer>*. This design is intended to permit implementations to use
efficient representations for element values, which use either more or
less space than a normal Dylan value. It is undefined whether any of
the other standard Dylan functions are atomic. Where atomicity is not
guaranteed, clients should guard against unexpected behavior by using
explicit synchronization, as appropriate.

Basic features
==============

This section documents basic features of the Threads module: operations
on threads and low-level synchronization.

Low-level synchronization
-------------------------

sequence-point
--------------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Tells the compiler that it must consider the possibility of visible side
effects from other threads at the point of the call.

Signature
         

sequence-point () => ()

Arguments
         

None.

Values
      

None.

Description
           

Tells the compiler that it must consider the possibility of visible side
effects from other threads at the point of the call.

Normally, the compiler is not obliged to consider this possibility, and
is free to rearrange program order provided that the reordering cannot
be detected within a thread.

Calling this function effectively prohibits the compiler from
rearranging the order of reads or writes from or to global data,
relative to the call. This function may disallow compiler optimizations,
leading to less efficient code — even for strongly ordered machines.

synchronize-side-effects
------------------------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

As *`sequence-point`_*, with the addition that all side effects that have
been performed within the calling thread are made visible within all other
threads.

Signature
         

synchronize-side-effects () => ()

Arguments
         

-  None.

Values
      

-  None.

Description
           

A call to this function implies all the constraints to the compiler of a
call to `sequence-point`_. In addition it ensures that all side effects
that have been performed within the calling thread are made visible within
all other threads. Hence, no side effect performed after the call can be
visible to other threads before side effects performed before the call.
On a strongly ordered machine, this function might legitimately be
performed as a null operation.

Some of the standard synchronization functions in the Threads module
also ensure the visibility of side effects and act as sequence points,
as if by a call to this function. This is defined to happen as follows:

-  Immediately before a thread exits and becomes available for joining
   with `join-thread`_
-  Before `thread-yield`_ yields control
-  After `wait-for`_ achieves synchronization (for all methods provided
   by the Threads module)
-  Upon entry to `release`_ (for all methods provided by the Threads
   module)
-  Upon entry to `release-all`_

Example
       

This example uses low-level synchronization to implement a class for
performing lazy evaluation in a thread-safe manner, without the need for
locks.

The class guarantees that the value will not be computed until it is
needed, although it does not guarantee that it will not be computed more
than once concurrently. This might be useful for memorization purposes.

The class uses 3 slots: one for a function which may be used to compute
the value, one for a boolean indicating whether the value is already
known, and one for the value itself, if known.

It is essential that no instance can ever be observed in a state where
the boolean indicates a known value before the value is present. The
low-level synchronization functions ensure this cannot happen.

define class <lazy-value> (<object>)
                                    

slot thunk :: <function>,

required-init-keyword: thunk:;

slot internal-guard :: <boolean> = #t;

slot computed-value;

end class;
          

define method lazy-value (lv :: <lazy-value>)
                                             

=> (value)

if (lv.internal-guard)
                      

// Don’t yet have a value == so compute it now;
                                               

let value = lv.thunk();
                       

// Store the value in place
                           

lv.computed-value := value;
                           

// Before droppping the guard, synchronize side
                                               

// effects to ensure there is no possibility that

// other threads might see the lowered guard

// before seeing the value
                          

synchronize-side-effects();

// Now we can drop the guard to permit other
                                            

// threads to use this value
                            

lv.internal-guard := #f;

// Finally, return the computed value

value

else // The value has already been computed and
                                               

// stored, so use it
                    

// First, need a sequence-point to force the
                                            

// compiler not to move the read of the

// computed-value so that it is performed BEFORE

// the read of the guard.
                         

sequence-point();

lv.computed-value;
                  

end if;
       

end method;

Operations on threads
---------------------

<thread>
--------

Sealed instantiable class
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of threads.

Superclasses
            

<object>

Init-keywords
             

-  *function* An in
-  stance of *<function>*. Required.
-  *priority* A signed integer.
-  *name* An instance of *<string>*.

Description
           

The class representing a thread of control executing *function*.

The *function* is called with no arguments in the empty dynamic
environment of the new thread. The thread terminates when the function
returns.

The function is executable immediately. You can suspend a new thread
(almost) immediately on creation by arranging for it to synchronize on
an unavailable resource upon entry to the function.

The optional *priority* keyword provides a scheduling priority for the
thread. The higher the value, the greater the priority. The default
value is zero, which is also the value of the constant
*$normal-priority*, one of several constants that correspond to useful
priority levels. The module offers no way to change the priority of a
thread dynamically.

The following constants, listed in order of increasing value, may be
useful as values for the optional *priority* keyword.

$low-priority
             

$background-priority

$normal-priority

$interactive-priority

$high-priority
              

The *name* keyword is a string that is used as the function’s name for
convenience purposes, such as debugging.

Operations
          

The class `\<thread\>`_ provides the following
operations:

-  `thread-name`_ Returns the name of a thread, or *#f* if no name was
   supplied.
-  `join-thread`_ Blocks until one of the specified threads has terminated,
   and returns the values of its function.

thread-name
-----------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Returns the name of a thread.

Signature
         

thread-name *thread* => *name-or-false*

Arguments
         

-  *thread* An instance of `\<thread\>`_.

Values
      

-  *name-or-false* An instance of *type-union(<string>,
    singleton(#f))*.

Description
           

Returns the name of *thread* as a string. If *thread* does not have a
name, this function returns *#f*.

join-thread
-----------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Waits for another, existing, thread to terminate, and then returns the
values of its function.

Signature
         

join-thread *thread* #rest *threads* => *thread-joined* #rest *results*

Arguments
         

-  *thread* An instance of `\<thread\>`_. A thread to join.
-  *threads* Instances of `\<thread\>`_. More threads to join.

Values
      

-  *thread-joined* An instance of `\<thread\>`_. The thread that was joined.
-  *results* Zero or more instances of *<object>*. The values returned
   from the thread that was joined.

Exceptions
          

An implementation of *join-thread* is permitted to signal the following
condition:

*<duplicate-join-error>*
                        

-  A condition of this class (a subclass of *<error>*) may be signalled
   when a thread is passed to *join-thread*, if that thread has already
   been joined by an earlier call to *join-thread*, or if that thread
   is currently active in another call to *join-thread*.

Description
           

Waits for another, existing, thread to terminate, by blocking if
necessary, and then returns the values of its function. The function
returns the thread object that was joined, along with any values its
function returns.

If more than one thread is passed to *join-thread*, the current thread
blocks until the first of those threads terminates. The values returned
are those of the first thread to terminate.

If one or more of the multiple threads has already terminated at the
time of the call, then one of those terminated threads is joined. When
more than one thread has already terminated, it is undefined which of
those threads the implementation will join.

It is an error to pass a thread to *join-thread* if it has already been
joined in a previous call to *join-thread*. It is an error to pass a
thread to *join-thread* if that thread is also being processed by
another simultaneous call to *join-thread* from another thread.

thread-yield
------------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Force the current thread to yield control to the part of the
implementation responsible for scheduling threads.

Signature
         

thread-yield () => ()

Description
           

Forces the current thread to yield control to the part of the
implementation responsible for scheduling threads. Doing so may have the
effect of allowing other threads to run, and may be essential to avoid
deadlock in a co-operative scheduling environment.

current-thread
--------------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Returns the current thread.

Signature
         

current-thread () => *thread*

Arguments
         

None.

Values
      

-  *thread* An instance of `\<thread\>`_.

Description
           

Returns the current thread.

Synchronization protocol
========================

Basic features
--------------

<synchronization>
-----------------

Open abstract class
'''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of objects that are used for inter-thread synchronization.

Superclasses
            

<object>

Init-keywords
             

-  *name:* An instance of *<string>*.

Description
           

The class of objects that are used for inter-thread synchronization.

There is no explicit mechanism in the module to block on a number of
synchronization objects simultaneously, until synchronization can be
achieved with one of them. This mechanism can be implemented by creating
a new thread to wait for each synchronization object, and arranging for
each thread to release a notification once synchronization has been
achieved.

The *name* keyword is a string that is used as the synchronization
object’s name for convenience purposes, such as debugging.

Operations
          

The class *<synchronization>* provides the following operations:

-  `wait-for`_ Block until synchronization can be achieved.
-  *`release`_* Release the object to make it available for synchronization.

`synchronization-name`_
                                               

-  Returns the name of the synchronization object.

wait-for
--------

Open generic function
'''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Blocks until a synchronization object is available.

Signature
         

wait-for *object* #key *timeout* => *success*

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<synchronization\>`_.
-  *timeout* Time-out interval. If the value is *#f* (the default), the
   time-out interval never elapses. Otherwise the value should be a
   *<real>*, corresponding to the desired interval in seconds.

Values
      

-  *success* An instance of *<boolean>*.

Description
           

Blocks until a synchronization object is available.

This function is the basic blocking primitive of the Threads module. It
blocks until *object* is available and synchronization can be achieved,
or the *timeout* interval has expired. A non-blocking synchronization
may be attempted by specifying a *timeout* of zero. Individual methods
may adjust the state of the synchronization object on synchronization.
The function returns *#t* if synchronization is achieved before the
timeout interval elapses; otherwise it returns *#f.*

release
-------

Open generic function
'''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Releases a synchronization object.

Signature
         

release *object* #key => ()

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<synchronization\>`_.

Values
      

None.

Description
           

Releases the supplied synchronization object, *object*, potentially
making it available to other threads. Individual methods describe what
this means for each class of synchronization. This function does not
block for any of the subclasses of `\<synchronization\>`_ provided by the
module.

synchronization-name
--------------------

Open generic function
'''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Returns the name of a synchronization object.

Signature
         

synchronization-name *object* => *name-or-false*

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<synchronization\>`_.

Values
      

-  *name-or-false* An instance of *type-union(<string>,
    singleton(#f))*.

Description
           

Returns the name of the synchronization object, *object*, if it was
created with the *name* init-keyword. Otherwise *#f* is returned.

Locks
-----

<lock>
------

Open abstract instantiable class
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of locks.

Superclasses
            

`\<synchronization\>`_

Description
           

Locks are synchronization objects which change state when they are
*claimed* (using `wait-for`_), and revert state when *released* (using
`release`_).

It is normally necessary for programs to ensure that locks are released,
otherwise there is the possibility of *deadlock*. Locks may be used to
restrict the access of other threads to shared resources between the
synchronization and the release. It is common for a protected operation
to be performed by a body of code which is evaluated in a single thread
between synchronization and release. A macro *`with-lock`_* is provided
for this purpose. When a thread uses a lock for *mutual-exclusion* in this
way, the thread is said to *own the lock*.

*<lock>* has no direct instances; calling *make* on *<lock>* returns an
instance of *<simple-lock>*.

Operations
          

The class *<lock>* provides the following operations:

-  *`with-lock`_* Execute a body of code between `wait-for`_ and
   `release`_ operations.

with-lock
---------

Statement macro
'''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Holds a lock while executing a body of code.

Macro call
          

with-lock (*lock*, #key *keys*)
                                 

*body*

[failure *failure-expr* ]

end
   

Arguments
         

-  *lock* An instance of `\<lock\>`_.
-  *keys* Zero or more of the keywords provided by *`wait-for`_*.
-  *body* A body of Dylan code.

Values
      

-  *values* Zero or more instances of *<object>*.

Exceptions
          

*with-lock* may signal a condition of the following class (a subclass of
*<serious-condition>*):

*<timeout-expired>*
                   

-  This is signalled when *with-lock* did not succeed in claiming the
   lock within the timeout period.

Description
           

Execute the *body* with *lock* held. If a *failure* clause is supplied,
then it will be evaluated and its values returned from *with-lock* if
the lock cannot be claimed (because a timeout occurred). The default, if
no *failure* clause is supplied, is to signal an exception of class
*<timeout-expired>*. If there is no failure, *with-lock* returns the
results of evaluating the body.

Example
       

If no *failure* clause is supplied, the macro expands into code
equivalent to the following:

let the-lock = *lock* ;

if (wait-for(the-lock, *keys ...*))
                                    

block ()

*body*...

cleanup

release(the-lock)

end block

else

signal(make(<timeout-expired>,

synchronization: the-lock)

end if
      

Semaphores
----------

<semaphore>
-----------

Open instantiable primary class
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of traditional counting semaphores.

Superclasses
            

<lock>

Description
           

The *<semaphore>* class is a class representing a traditional counting
semaphore. An instance of *<semaphore>* contains a counter in its
internal state. Calling `release`_ on a semaphore increments the
internal count. Calling `wait-for`_ on a semaphore decrements the internal
count, unless it is zero, in which case the thread blocks until another
thread releases the semaphore.

Semaphores are less efficient than exclusive locks, but they have
asynchronous properties which may be useful (for example for managing
queues or pools of shared resources). Semaphores may be released by any
thread, so there is no built-in concept of a thread owning a semaphore.
It is not necessary for a thread to release a semaphore after waiting
for it — although semaphores may be used as locks if they do.

Init-keywords
             

-  *initial-count* A non-negative integer, corresponding to the initial
   state of the internal counter. The default value is 0.
-  *maximum-count* A non-negative integer corresponding to the maximum
   permitted value of the internal counter. The default value is the
   largest value supported by the implementation, which is the value of
   the constant *$semaphore-maximum-count-limit*. This constant will
   not be smaller than 10000.

wait-for
--------

Sealed method
'''''''''''''

Summary
       

Claims a semaphore object.

Signature
         

wait-for *object* #key *timeout* => *success*

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<semaphore\>`_. The semaphore object to wait for.
-  *timeout* Time-out interval. If the value is *#f* (the default), the
   time-out interval never elapses. Otherwise the value should be a
   *<real>*, corresponding to the desired interval in seconds.

Values
      

-  *success* An instance of *<boolean>*.

Description
           

Decrements the internal count of the semaphore object, blocking if the
count is zero.

release
-------

Sealed method
'''''''''''''

Summary
       

Releases a semaphore object.

Signature
         

release *object* #key => ()

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<semaphore\>`_.

Values
      

-  None.

Exceptions
          

An implementation of this *release* method is permitted to signal a
condition of the following class, which is a subclass of *<error>* :

*<count-exceeded-error>*
                        

-  This may be signalled when an attempt is made to release a
   `\<semaphore\>`_ when the internal counter is
   already at its maximum count.

Description
           

Releases a semaphore object, by incrementing its internal count.

Exclusive locks
---------------

<exclusive-lock>
----------------

Open abstract instantiable class
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of locks which prohibit unlocking by threads that do not own
the lock.

Superclasses
            

<lock>

Description
           

The class of locks which prohibit unlocking by threads that do not own
the lock.

The notion of ownership is directly supported by the class, and a thread
can test whether an *<exclusive-lock>* is currently owned. An instance
of *<exclusive-lock>* can only be owned by one thread at a time, by
calling *wait-for* on the lock.

Once owned, any attempt by any other thread to wait for the lock will
cause that thread to block. It is an error for a thread to release an
*<exclusive-lock>* if another thread owns it.

*<exclusive-lock>* has no direct instances; calling *make* on
*<exclusive-lock>* returns an instance of `\<simple-lock\>`_.

Operations
          

The class *<exclusive-lock>* provides the following operations:

-  `owned?`_ Tests to see if the lock has been claimed by the current thread.

release
-------

Protocol
''''''''

Summary
       

Releases an exclusive lock.

Signature
         

release *object* #key => ()

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<exclusive-lock\>`_.

Values
      

-  None.

Exceptions
          

Implementations of *release* methods for subclasses of `\<exclusive-lock\>`_
are permitted to signal a condition of the following class, which is a
subclass of *<error>* :

*<not-owned-error>*
                   

-  This may be signalled when an attempt is made to release an
   `\<exclusive-lock\>`_ when the lock is not owned by the current thread.

Description
           

Releases a lock that is owned by the calling thread. It is an error if
the lock is not owned.

The Threads module does not provide a method on *release* for
`\<exclusive-lock\>`_, which is an open abstract class. Each concrete
subclass will have an applicable method which may signal errors
according to the protocol described above.

Multiple reader / single writer locks
-------------------------------------

<read-write-lock>
-----------------

Open instantiable primary class
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of locks that can have multiple readers but only one writer.

Superclasses
            

`\<exclusive-lock\>`_

Description
           

The class of locks that can have multiple readers but only one writer.

The *<read-write-lock>* class can be locked in either of two modes,
*read* and *write*. A write lock is exclusive, and implies ownership of
the lock. However, a read lock is non-exclusive, and an instance can be
locked multiple times in read mode, whether by multiple threads,
recursively by a single thread, or a combination of both.

A *<read-write-lock>* can only be locked in write mode if the lock is
free, and the operation will block if necessary. It can only be freed by
the thread that owns it.

A *<read-write-lock>* can be locked in read mode provided that it is not
owned with a write lock. The operation will block while the lock is
owned. Each time it is locked in read mode, an internal counter is
incremented. This counter is decremented each time a read-mode lock is
released. The lock is freed when the counter becomes zero.

The *<read-write-lock>* class is less efficient than the other lock
classes defined in the Threads module. However, it provides an
efficient and convenient means to protect data that is frequently read
and may occasionally be written by multiple concurrent threads.

wait-for
--------

Sealed method
'''''''''''''

Summary
       

Claims a read-write lock.

Signature
         

wait-for *object* #key *timeout* *mode*

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<read-write-lock\>`_.
-  *timeout* Time-out interval. If the value is *#f* (the default), the
   time-out interval never elapses. Otherwise the value should be a
   *<real>*, corresponding to the desired interval in seconds.
-  *mode* The mode of the lock to wait for. Valid values are *#"read"*
   (the default) and *#"write"*, which wait for locks in read mode and
   write mode respectively.

Values
      

-  *success* An instance of *<boolean>*.

Description
           

Claims a read-write lock, blocking if necessary. The behavior depends on
the value of *mode* :

-  *#"read"* If there is a write lock, blocks until the lock becomes
   free. Then claims the lock by incrementing its internal read-lock
   counter.
-  *#"write"* First waits until the lock becomes free, by blocking if
   necessary. Then claims exclusive ownership of the lock in write mode.

If the claim is successful, this method returns true; otherwise it
returns false.

release
-------

Sealed method
'''''''''''''

Summary
       

Releases a read-write-lock.

Signature
         

release object #key => ()

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<read-write-lock\>`_.

Values
      

-  None.

Description
           

Releases a read-write lock.

If the lock is owned by the calling thread, it is freed. If the lock is
locked in read mode, the count of the number of locks held is
decremented; the lock is freed if the count becomes zero. Otherwise it
is an error to release the lock, and an implementation is permitted to
signal a *<not-owned-error>* condition.

owned?
------

Summary
       

Tests whether a read-write lock is owned — that is, has been locked in
write mode — by the current thread.

owned? *object* => *owned?*

Arguments
         

-  *object* An instance of `\<read-write-lock\>`_.

Tests whether a read-write lock is owned — that is, has been locked in
write mode — by the current thread.

Notifications
-------------

<notification>
--------------

Sealed instantiable class
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class of objects that can be used to notify threads of a change of
state elsewhere in the program.

Superclasses
            

<synchronization>

Init-keywords
             

-  *lock:* An instance of `\<simple-lock\>`_.
   Required.

Description
           

The class of objects that can be used to notify threads of a change of
state elsewhere in the program. Notifications are used in association
with locks, and are sometimes called *condition variables*. They may be
used to support the sharing of data between threads using *monitors*.
Each *<notification>* is permanently associated with a `\<simple-lock\>`_,
although the same lock may be associated with many notifications.

The required *lock* is associated with the notification, and it is only
possible to wait for, or release, the notification if the lock is owned.

Threads wait for the change of state to be notified by calling
`wait-for`_. Threads notify other threads of the change of state by calling
`release`_.

Operations
          

The class *<notification>* provides the following operations:

-  `associated-lock`_ Returns the lock associated with the notification object.
-  `wait-for`_ Wait for the notification of the
   change in state. The associated lock must be owned, and is atomically
   released before synchronization, and reclaimed after.
-  `release`_ Notify the change of state to a
   single waiting thread. This has no effect on the associated lock,
   which must be owned.
-  `release-all`_ Notify the change of state to
   all waiting threads. This has no effect on the associated lock, which
   must be owned.

Example
       

This example shows how to use a notification and an associated lock to
implement a queue. The variable *\*queue\** is the actual queue object
(a *<deque>*). Queue access is performed by interlocking pushes and
pops on the *<deque>*. The *\*queue\** variable can be a constant,
since it is the *<deque>* which is mutated and not the value of
*\*queue\**.

define constant \*queue\* = make(<deque>);

The variable *\*lock\** is used to isolate access to the queue

define constant \*lock\* = make(<lock>);

The variable *\*something-queued\** is a notification which is used to
notify other threads that an object is being put onto an empty queue.

define constant \*something-queued\* =
                                      

make(<notification>, lock: \*lock\*);
                                     

The function *put-on-queue* pushes an object onto the queue. If the
queue was initially empty, then all threads which are waiting for the
queue to fill are notified that there is a new entry.

define method put-on-queue (object) => ()
                                         

with-lock (\*lock\*)

if (\*queue\*.empty?)

release-all(\*something-queued\*)

end;

push(\*queue\*, object)

end with-lock

end method;
           

The *get-from-queue* function returns an object from the queue. If no
object is immediately available, then it blocks until it receives a
notification that the queue is no longer empty. After receiving the
notification it tests again to see if an object is present, in case it
was popped by another thread.

define method get-from-queue () => (object)
                                           

with-lock (\*lock\*)

while (\*queue\*.empty?)

wait-for(\*something-queued\*)

end;

pop(\*queue\*)

end with-lock

end method;
           

associated-lock
---------------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Returns the lock associated with the notification object supplied.

Signature
         

associated-lock *notification* => *lock*

Arguments
         

-  *notification* An instance of `\<notification\>`_.

Values
      

-  *lock* An instance of `\<simple-lock\>`_.

Description
           

Returns the lock associated with the notification object *notification*
.

wait-for
--------

Sealed method
'''''''''''''

Summary
       

Wait for another thread to release a notification.

Signature
         

wait-for *notification* #key *timeout* => *success*

Arguments
         

-  *notification* An instance of `\<notification\>`_.
-  *timeout* Time-out interval. If the value is *#f* (the default), the
   time-out interval never elapses. Otherwise the value should be a
   *<real>*, corresponding to the desired interval in seconds.

Values
      

-  *success* An instance of *<boolean>*.

Description
           

Wait for another thread to release *notification*. The lock associated
with the notification must be owned. Atomically, the lock is released
and the current thread starts blocking, waiting for another thread to
release the notification. The current thread reclaims the lock once it
has received the notification.

Note that the state should be tested again once *wait-for* has returned,
because there may have been a delay between the `release`_ of the
notification and the claiming of the lock, and the state may have been
changed during that time. If a timeout is supplied, then this is used
for waiting for the release of the notification only. The *wait-for*
function always waits for the lock with no timeout, and it is guaranteed
that the lock will be owned on return. The *wait-for* function returns *#f*
if the notification wait times out.

Exceptions
          

Implementations of this *wait-for* method are permitted to signal a
condition of the following class, which is a subclass of *<error>* :

*<not-owned-error>*
                   

-  Implementations can signal this error if the application attempts to
   wait for a notification when the associated lock is not owned by the
   current thread.

release
-------

Sealed method
'''''''''''''

Summary
       

Releases a notification to one of the threads that are blocked and
waiting for it.

Signature
         

release *notification* #key => ()

Arguments
         

-  *notification* An instance of `\<notification\>`_.

Values
      

None.

Exceptions
          

Implementations of this *release* method are permitted to signal a
condition of the following class, which is a subclass of *<error>* :

*<not-owned-error>*
                   

-  Implementations can signal this error if the application attempts to
   release a notification when the associated lock is not owned by the
   current thread.

Description
           

Releases *notification*, announcing the change of state to one of the
threads which are blocked and waiting for it. The choice of which thread
receives the notification is undefined. The receiving thread may not be
unblocked immediately, because it must first claim ownership of the
notification’s associated lock.

release-all
-----------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Release a notification to all the threads that are blocked and waiting
for it.

Signature
         

release-all *notification* => ()

Arguments
         

-  *notification* An instance of `\<notification\>`_.

Exceptions
          

Implementations of the *release-all* function are permitted to signal a
condition of the following class, which is a subclass of *<error>* :

*<not-owned-error>*
                   

-  This may be signalled when an attempt is made to release a
   notification when the associated lock is not owned by the current
   thread.

Description
           

Releases *notification*, announcing the change of state to all threads
which are blocked and waiting for it. Those threads will then
necessarily have to compete for the lock associated with the
notification.

Timers
======

sleep
-----

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Blocks the current thread for a specified number of seconds.

Signature
         

sleep *interval* => ()

Arguments
         

-  *interval* An instance of *<real>*.

Values
      

None.

Description
           

Blocks the current thread for the number of seconds specified in
*interval*.

Thread variables
================

thread
------

Variable definition adjective
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

An adjective to *define variable* for defining thread variables.

Macro call
          

define thread variable *bindings* = *init* ;

Description
           

An adjective to *define variable*. The construct *define thread
variable* defines module variables in the current module which have
thread-local bindings. The initialization expression is evaluated once,
and is used to provide the initial values for the variables in each
thread. The value of a thread variable binding may be changed with the
normal assignment operator *:=*. This assignment is not visible in
other threads.

Example
       

define thread variable \*standard-output\*
                                          

= make(<standard-output-stream>);
                                 

Dynamic binding
===============

dynamic-bind
------------

Statement macro
'''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Executes a body of code in a context in which variables are dynamically
rebound.

Macro call
          

dynamic-bind (*place1* = *init1*, *place2* = *init2*, ...) *body* end;

Description
           

Executes *body* with the specified *places* rebound in the dynamic
environment, each place being initialized to the results of evaluating
the initialization expressions. In other words, the places are
initialized to new values on entry to the body but restored to their old
values once the body has finished executing, whether because it finishes
normally, or because of a non-local transfer of control. Typically, each
*place* is a thread variable.

If the *place* is a *name*, it must be the name of a thread variable in
the module scope.

Example
       

The following example shows the dynamic binding of a single variable.

dynamic-bind (\*standard-output\* = new-val())
                                              

top-level-loop ()

end;
    

This expands into code equivalent to the following:

begin
     

let old-value = \*standard-output\*;

block ()

\*standard-output\* := new-val();

top-level-loop()

cleanup

\*standard-output\* := old-value

end

end
   

An extended form of dynamic-bind
--------------------------------

Some implementations of the Threads module may provide an extended form
of *dynamic-bind* for binding places other than variables. The
implementation of this extended form requires the use of non-standard
features in the Dylan macro system, and hence cannot be written as a
portable macro. These non-standard extensions are subject to discussion
amongst the Dylan language designers, and may eventually become standard
features. Until such time as standardization occurs, implementations are
not mandated to implement the extended form of *dynamic-bind*, and
portable code should not depend upon this feature.

The extended form is described below.

dynamic-bind
------------

Statement macro
'''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Executes a body of code in a context in which variables or other places
are dynamically rebound.

Macro call
          

dynamic-bind (*place1* = *init1*, *place2* = *init2*, ...) body end;

(This is the same as the simple form.)

Description
           

If *place* is not a name, then it may have the syntax of a call to a
function. This permits an extended form for *dynamic-bind*, by analogy
with the extended form for *:=*. In this case, if the place appears
syntactically as *name(* *arg1* *,*... *argn* *)*, then the macro
expands into a call to the function

name-dynamic-binder(*init*, *body-method*, *arg1*, ... *argn*)

where *init* is the initial value for the binding, and *body-method* is
function with no parameters whose body is the *body of* the
*dynamic-bind*. The extended form also permits the other “*.* ” and
“*[]* ”syntaxes for function calls.

There are no features in the current version of the Threads module
which make use of the extended form of *dynamic-bind*.

Example
       

The following example shows the extended form of *dynamic-bind*.

dynamic-bind (object.a-slot = new-slot-val())
                                             

inner-body(object)

end;
    

This expands into code equivalent to the following:

a-slot-dynamic-binder(new-slot-val(),
                                     

method () inner-body(object) end,

object)
       

Locked variables
================

locked
------

Variable definition adjective
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Defines a locked variable.

Macro call
          

define locked variable *bindings* = *init* ;

Description
           

An adjective to *define variable*. The construct *define locked
variable* defines module variables in the current module that can be
tested and updated with `conditional-update!`_, `atomic-increment!`_,
or `atomic-decrement!`_.

Other threads are prevented from modifying the locked variable during
the conditional update operation by means of a low-level locking
mechanism, which is expected to be extremely efficient.

Operations

- `conditional-update!`_ Atomically compare and conditionally assign to the variable.
- `atomic-increment!`_ Atomically increment the variable.
- `atomic-decrement!`_  Atomically decrement the variable.

Example
       

define locked variable \*number-detected\* = 0;

Conditional update
==================

conditional-update!
-------------------

Statement macro
'''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Performs an atomic test-and-set operation.

Macro call
          

conditional-update!(*local-name* = *place*)
 *body
* [success *success-expr* ]
 [failure *failure-expr* ]
 end

Arguments
         

-  *local-name* A Dylan variable-name*bnf*.
-  *place* A Dylan variable-namebnf,
-  If the implementation provides the extended form of `conditional-update!`_,
   *place* can also be a function call.
-  *body* A Dylan body *bnf*.

Values
      

-  See Description.

Description
           

Performs an atomic test-and-set operation. Where appropriate, it should
be implemented using dedicated processor instructions, and is expected
to be extremely efficient on most platforms.

The value of the *place* is evaluated once to determine the initial
value, which is then bound to the *local-name* as a lexical variable.
The *body* is then evaluated to determine the new value for the place.
The place is then conditionally updated — which means that the following
steps are performed atomically:

#. The place is evaluated again, and a test is made to see if it has
   been updated since the initial evaluation. This may involve a
   comparison with the old value using *==*, though implementations
   might use a more direct test for there having been an assignment to
   the place. It is undefined whether the test will succeed or fail in
   the case where the place was updated with a value that is identical
   to the old value when compared using *\\==*.
#. If the value was found not to have been updated since the initial
   evaluation, the new value is stored by assignment. Otherwise the
   conditional update fails.

If the update was successful, then *conditional-update!* returns the
result of the *success* expression, or returns the new value of the
place if no *success* clause was supplied.

If the update failed, then *conditional-update!* signals a condition,
unless a *failure* clause was given, in which case the value is
returned.

If the *place* is a *name*, it must be the name of a *locked variable*
in the current module scope. See `Locked variables`_.

Exceptions
          

*conditional-update!* may signal a condition of the following class
(which is a subclass of *<error>*), unless a *failure* clause is
supplied.

<conditional-update-error>

Example
       

The following example does an atomic increment of *\*number-detected\**
.

until (conditional-update!
                          

(current-val = \*number-detected\*)

current-val + 1

failure #f

end conditional-update!)

end until
         

atomic-increment!
-----------------

Function macro
''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Atomically increments a place containing a numeric value.

Macro call
          

atomic-increment!(*place*);

atomic-increment!(*place*, *by*);

Arguments
         

-  *place* A Dylan variable-namebnf.
-  If the implementation provides the extended form of
   *conditional-update!*, *place* can also be a function call.
-  *by* An instance of *<object>*. Default value: 1.

Values
      

-  *new-value* An instance of *<object>*.

Description
           

Atomically increments a place containing a numeric value.

The value of the *place* is evaluated one or more times to determine the
initial value. A new value is computed from this value and *by*, by
applying *+* from the Dylan module. The new value is atomically stored
back into *place*.

The macro returns the new value of *place*.

The *place* must be a suitable place for *conditional-update!*.

Implementations of *atomic-increment!* are permitted to use
*conditional-update!* (as in the described example), and hence can
involve a loop and can cause *place* to be evaluated more than once.
However, an atomic increment of a locked variable might be implemented
by a more efficient non-looping mechanism on some platforms.

Example
       

The following example atomically increments *\*number-detected\** by 2,
and returns the incremented value.

atomic-increment!(\*number-detected\*, 2);

atomic-decrement!
-----------------

Function macro
''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Atomically decrements a place containing a numeric value.

Macro call
          

atomic-decrement!(*place*)

atomic-decrement!(*place, by*)

Arguments
         

-  *place* A Dylan variable-namebnf.
-  If the implementation provides the extended form of
   *conditional-update!*, *place* can also be a function call.
-  *by* An instance of *<object>*. Default value: 1.

Values
      

-  *new-value* An instance of *<object>*.

Description
           

Atomically decrements a place containing a numeric value. It has the
same semantics as *atomic-increment!* with the exception that the
*place* is decremented.

An extended form of conditional-update!
---------------------------------------

Some implementations of the Threads module may provide an extended form
of *conditional-update!* for updating places other than locked
variables. The implementation of this extended form requires the use of
non-standard features in the Dylan macro system, and hence cannot be
written as a portable macro. These non-standard extensions are subject
to discussion amongst the Dylan language designers, and may eventually
become features. Until such time as standardization occurs,
implementations are not mandated to implement the extended form of
*conditional-update!*, and portable code should not depend upon the
feature.

conditional-update!
-------------------

Statement macro
'''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Performs an atomic test-and-set operation.

Macro call
          

conditional-update!(*local-name* = *place*)
 *body
* [success *success-expr* ]
 [failure *failure-expr* ]
 end

Arguments
         

-  *local-name* A Dylan variable-name*bnf*.
-  *place* A Dylan variable-namebnf or a function call.
-  *body* A Dylan body*bnf*.

Values
      

-  See Description.

Description
           

This extended form of *conditional-update!* additionally accepts a
*place* that has the syntax of a call to a function. This extended form
for *conditional-update!* is analogous to that for *:=*. In this case,
if the *place* appears syntactically as

*name* (*arg* 1, … *arg* n)

The macro expands into this call:

*name* -conditional-updater(*new-value*, *local-name*, *arg* 1, …
*arg* n)
                                                                            

If the result of this function call is *#f*, the conditional update is
deemed to have failed.
