*********************
DUIM-Geometry Library
*********************

Overview
========

The DUIM-Geometry library provides basic support for coordinate
geometry. This allows the position of elements in a window object to be
determined correctly. The library contains a single module,
*duim-geometry*, from which all the interfaces described in this
chapter are exposed. `DUIM-Geometry Module`_
contains complete reference entries for each exposed interface.

The class hierarchy for DUIM-Geometry
=====================================

The base classes for classes in the DUIM-Geometry library are ``<region>``
and ``<transform>``, both of which are subclasses of :drm:`<object>`. While
the ``<region>`` class has a number of subclasses, ``<transform>`` has no
direct subclasses.

-  ``<transform>`` The superclass of all transforms. A transform describes
   the mapping of one set of points onto another. There are one or more
   subclasses of `<transform>`_ that implement
   transforms. These subclasses have implementation-dependent names
   which are explicitly unspecified. All of the instantiable
   transformation classes provided by DUIM are immutable.

In addition, there are a number of error classes which may be signalled.
These are all subclasses of :drm:`<error>`.

The <region> class and its subclasses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DUIM-Geometry library exposes the <region> class and its subclasses
as shown in Table `The <region> class and its
subclasses`_. None of these subclasses have any further
subclasses exposed in the DUIM-Geometry library, although the
DUIM-Extended-Geometry library exposes some subclasses of *<area>* and
*<path>*.

<region>

<region-set>

<point>

<path>

<area>

<bounding-box>

-  *<region>* This class is used to represent any set of points.
   The*<region>* class includes both bounded regions (that is, regions
   whose edges are known) and unbounded regions (that is, regions with
   no known edges).
-  *<region-set>* This class represents a region set, that is, a set of
   regions.
-  *<point>* This class is used to represent mathematical points (that
   is, regions with dimensionality 0).
-  *<path>* The class *<path>* denotes bounded regions with a length,
   but no area (that is, they have dimensionality 1).
-  *<area>* This class denotes bounded regions that have an area (that
   is, they have dimensionality 2).
-  *<bounding-box>* A bounding box is an axis aligned rectangle that
   contains some region.

Error classes provided by DUIM-Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DUIM-Geometry library exposes a number of errors that can be
signalled in certain circumstances. They are shown in Table `The
<transform-error> class and its subclasses`_. All the
errors shown are subclasses of the *<error>* class. Note that the
subclasses of *<transform-error>* are all specific to particular errors.

<bounding-box>
--------------

Open abstract instantiable class
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

The class that represents a bounding box.

Superclasses
            

*<region>*

Init-keywords
             

-  *left:* An instance of type *<integer>*.
-  *top:* An instance of type *<integer>*.
-  *right:* An instance of type *<integer>*.
-  *bottom:* An instance of type *<integer>*.

Description
           

A bounding box is an axis aligned rectangle that contains some region.
The representation of bounding boxes in DUIM is chosen to be efficient.
This representation is not sufficient to represent the result of
arbitrary transformations (such as rotations) of bounding boxes. The
most general class of transformations that is guaranteed to transform a
box into another box is the class of transformations that satisfy
*rectilinear-transformation?*.

Bounding boxes are immutable, but since they reflect the live state of
such mutable objects as sheets, bounding boxes are volatile. Therefore,
programmers must not depend on the bounding box associated with a
mutable object remaining constant.

Arguments
         

-  *function* An instance of type *<function>*.
-  *coordinates* An instance of type *limited(<sequence>, of: <real>)*.

Values
      

None

Description

of *coordinates* must be a multiple of 2. *Function* takes two
arguments, the *x* and *y* value of each coordinate pair.

do-endpoint-coordinates
-----------------------

Function
''''''''

Summary
       

Applies a function to each coordinate pair in its argument list.

Signature
         

*do-endpoint-coordinates* *function* *coordinates* => ()

Arguments
         

-  *function* An instance of type *<function>*.
-  *coordinates* An instance of type *limited(<sequence>, of: <real>)*.

Values
      

None

Description
           

Applies *function* to each pair of coordinate pairs in *coordinates*.
The arguments *coordinates* represents a set of line segments rather
than a set of points: The length of this sequence must therefore be a
multiple of 4. Function takes 4 arguments, (*x1*, *y1*, *x2*, *y2*).

do-regions
----------

Generic function
''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Calls a function on each region in a set of regions.

Signature
         

*do-regions* *function* *region* *#key* *normalize?* => ()

Arguments
         

-  *function* An instance of type *<function>*.
-  *region* An instance of type *<region>*.
-  *normalize?* An instance of type *<boolean>*. Default value: *#f*.

Values
      

None

Description
           

Calls *function* on each region in the region set *region.* This is
often more efficient than calling *region-set-regions*. *function* is a
function of one argument, a region. *Region* can be either a region set
or a simple region, in which case *function* is called once on *region*
itself. If *normalize* is supplied, it must be either *#"x-banding"* or
*#"y-banding"*. If it is *#"x-banding"* and all the regions in *region*
are axis-aligned rectangles, the result is normalized by merging
adjacent rectangles with banding done in the *x* direction. If it is
*#"y-banding"* and all the regions in *region* are rectangles, the
result is normalized with banding done in the *y* direction. Normalizing
a region set that is not composed entirely of axis-aligned rectangles
using x- or y-banding causes DUIM to signal the
*<region-set-not-rectangular>* error.

Returns an object of the class *`<bounding-box>`_*
with the edges specified by *x1, y1, x2*, and *y2. x1, y1, x2*, and

box has an *x* coordinate that is the larger of *x1* and *x2* and a *y*
coordinate that is the larger of *y1* and *y2*. (Therefore, in a
right-handed coordinate system the canonicalized values of *x1, y1, x2,*

A rotation is a transform that preserves length and angles of all
geometric entities. Rotations also preserve one point (the origin) and
the distance of all entities from that point.

The function *make-rotation-transform\** is identical to
*make-rotation-transform*, except that it passes composite objects,
rather than separate coordinates, in its arguments. You should be aware

-  *scale-y* An instance of type *<real>*.

The following arguments are specific to *make-scaling-transform*.

-  *origin-x* An instance of type *<real>*. Default value: 0.
-  *origin-y* An instance of type *<real>*. Default value: 0.

The following argument is specific to *make-scaling-transform\**.

-  *origin* An instance of type `<point>`_.

Values
      

-  *transform* An instance of type `<transform>`_.
   The resultant transformation.

Description
           

Returns a transform that multiplies the *x* -coordinate distance of
every point from *origin* by *scale-x* and the *y* -coordinate distance
of every point from *origin* by *scale-y*.

The argument *scale-x* represents the scaling factor for the *x*
direction.

The argument *scale-y* represents the scaling factor for the *y*
direction.

The arguments *origin-x* and *origin-y* represent the point around which
scaling is performed. The default is to scale around the origin.

There is no single definition of a scaling transformation. Transforms
that preserve all angles and multiply all lengths by the same factor
(preserving the *shape* of all entities) are certainly scaling
transformations. However, scaling is also used to refer to transforms
that scale distances in the *x* direction by one amount and distances in
the *y* direction by another amount.

The function *make-scaling-transform\** is identical to
*make-scaling-transform*, except that it passes composite objects,
rather than separate coordinates, in its arguments. You should be aware
that using this function may lead to a loss of performance.

axis-aligned rectangle into another axis-aligned rectangle, otherwise
returns *#f*.

This category includes scalings as a subset, and also includes 90 degree
rotations.

Rectilinear transforms are the most general category of transforms for
which the bounding rectangle of a transformed object can be found by
transforming the bounding rectangle of the original object.

Exceptions
          

Normalizing a region set that is not composed entirely of axis-aligned
rectangles using x- or y-banding causes DUIM to signal the
*<region-set-not-rectangular>* error.

Description
           

Returns a sequence of the regions in the region set *region*.*region*
can be either a region set or a simple region, in which case the result
is simply a sequence of one element: region.

For the case of region sets that are unions of axis-aligned rectangles,
the rectangles returned by *region-set-regions* are guaranteed not to
overlap. If *normalize* is supplied, it must be either *#"x-banding"* or
*#"y-banding"*. If it is *#"x-banding"* and all the regions in *region*
are axis-aligned rectangles, the result is normalized by merging
adjacent rectangles with banding done in the *x* direction. If it is

The result of *region-union* always has dimensionality that is the
maximum dimensionality of *region1* and *region2*. For example, the
union of a path and an area produces an area; the union of two paths is
a path.

*Note*: *region-union* may return either a simple region or a region
set.

translation-transform?
----------------------

Generic function
''''''''''''''''

Summary
       

Returns *#t* if a transform is a pure translation, that is, a transform
such that there are two distance components transform *dx* and *dy* and
every point *(x,y)* is moved to *(x+dx,y+dy)*.

Signature
         

*translation-transform?* *transform* => *boolean*

Arguments
         

-  *transform* An instance of type `<transform>`_.

Values
      

-  *boolean* An instance of type *<boolean>*.

Description
           

Returns *#t* if the transform *transform* is a pure translation, that
is, a transform such that there are two distance components transform
*dx* and *dy* and every point *(x,y)* is moved to *(x+dx,y+dy)*.
Otherwise, *translation-transform?* returns *#f*.
