*****************
The Format Module
*****************

Introduction
============

This chapter describes the Format module. The Format module is exported
from the IO library. This module extends the functionality of the format
strings described in Dylan’s condition system and provides two new
functions for processing the extended format strings. The Format module
is a small module, but it uses the printing modules and some of the
Streams module. :doc:`print` and :doc:`streams` give full details of
the Print and Streams libraries.

The ``format`` module exports all the identifiers described in this
chapter.

Control strings
===============

The Format module’s format strings, or control strings, offer the same
directives as Dylan’s format strings offer, but Format provides a few
more directives, and permits a single argument to all format directives.

The argument is an integer that must appear contiguously between the
dispatch character, ``%``, and the format directive. The argument
indicates a printing field in which to justify the output of the
directive. A positive integer indicates that the output should be flush
right within the field, and a negative integer indicates the output
should be flush left within the field. If the output length is greater
than the field’s width, then output occurs as if there were no field
specification. The following are examples of valid format directives:

::

    %S
    %s
    %15D
    %-10=

The directives are:

-  ``%S`` Prints the next format argument as a message by calling the
   function ``print-message`` on the format argument and the stream. This
   directive is the same as Dylan’s ``%S`` format-string directive except
   for two features: (i) this module’s ``%S`` directive outputs character
   objects, and (ii) you can extend the ``%S`` functionality by adding
   methods to ``print-message``.
-  ``%=`` Prints the next format argument by calling the
   ` <print.htm#58823>`_ function from the Print module on the format
   argument and the stream. You can extend the ``%=`` functionality by
   adding methods to the ` <print.htm#63563>`_ function from the Print
   module.
-  ``%C`` Print the next format argument, which must be a character,
   according to Dylan’s ``%S`` format-string directive. This module’s ``%C``
   directive is the same as this module’s ``%S`` directive.
-  ``%D`` Prints a decimal representation of the next format argument,
   which must be an integer.
-  ``%B`` Prints a binary representation of the next format argument,
   which must be an integer.
-  ``%O`` Prints an octal representation of the next format argument,
   which must be an integer.
-  ``%X`` Prints a hexadecimal representation of the next format argument,
   which must be an integer.
-  ``%M`` Invokes the next format argument, which must be a function, on
   the stream passed to ``format``.
-  ``%%`` Outputs a single ``%`` character.

The FORMAT module
=================

This section contains a reference entry for each item exported from the
Format module.

format
------

Function

Summary

Outputs a control string to a stream.

Signature

.. code-block:: dylan

    format *stream* *control-string* *arguments* => ()

Arguments

-  ``stream`` An instance of ``<stream>``. The stream to which formatted
   output should be sent.
-  ``control-string`` An instance of ``<string>``. A string containing
   format directives.
-  ``arguments`` Instances of ``<object>``.

Values

None.

Description

Sends output to ``stream`` according to the format directives in
``control-string``. Each directive consumes one argument from ``arguments``.
See `Control strings`_ for a description of the control strings that can
be used.

The ``control-string`` contents that are not part of any directive are
output directly to ``stream``, as if by the Streams module’s ``write``
function.

format
------

G.f. method

Summary

Outputs a control string to a stream.

Arguments

-  ``stream`` An instance of ``<stream>``.
-  ``control-string`` An instance of ``<byte-string>``.
-  ``arguments`` Instances of ``<object>``.

Values

None.

Description

There is one method for ``format``, and it is specialized to
``<byte-string>``.

format-to-string
----------------

Function

Summary

Returns a formatted string based on a format control string.

Arguments

-  ``control-string`` An instance of ``<string>``.
-  ``arguments`` Instances of ``<object>``.

Values

-  ``result`` An instance of ``<string>``.

Description

Calls ``format`` to produce output according to ``control-string`` and
returns the output as a string.

format-to-string
----------------

G.f. method

Summary

Returns a formatted string based on a format control string.

Arguments

-  ``control-string`` An instance of ``<byte-string>``.
-  ``arguments`` Instances of ``<object>``.

Values

-  ``result`` An instance of ``<byte-string>``.

Description

There is one method for ``format-to-string``. The ``control-string``
argument must be a ``<byte-string>``. Result is a ``<byte-string>``.

print-message
-------------

Function

Summary

Prints an object to a stream.

Arguments

-  ``object`` An instance of ``<object>``.
-  ``stream`` An instance of ``<stream>``.

Values

None.

Description

Prints ``object`` to ``stream``.

Methods for this function should print objects as a message, as opposed
to printing them in any form intending to represent Dylan data, literal
syntax, and so on.

For example, printing a condition object with this function presents the
condition as an error message, but printing the condition object with
the ``print`` function from the Print module prints the condition in some
form such as

::

    {Simple-error}

See the individual methods for the details of how this function prints
various objects. This function exists to define the behavior of the ``%S``
format directive and to allow users the ability to extend the ``%S``
directive. Users should have little need to call this function directly.

print-message
-------------

Sealed g.f method

Summary

Prints a condition to a stream as an error message.

Arguments

-  ``condition`` An instance of ``<condition>``.
-  ``stream`` An instance of ``<stream>``.

Values

None.

Description

Prints ``condition`` as an error message, as described for the Dylan ``%S``
format directive. You should not specialize the ``print-message`` protocol
for subclasses of ``<condition>``, but instead extend the ``print-message``
protocol to new condition objects by specializing methods on
``report-condition``.

print-message
-------------

Sealed g.f. method

Summary

Prints a symbol to a stream.

Signature

.. code-block:: dylan

    print-message *symbol* *stream* => ()

Arguments

-  ``symbol`` An instance of ``<symbol>``.
-  ``stream`` An instance of ``<stream>``.

Values

None.

Description

Prints ``symbol`` to ``stream`` by converting it to a string with the ``as``
function and then writing the string with the ``write`` function from the
Streams module.

print-message
-------------

Sealed g.f. method

Summary

Prints an object to a stream.

Signature

.. code-block:: dylan

    print-message *object* *stream* => ()

Arguments

-  ``object`` An instance of ``type-union(<string>, <character>)``.
-  ``stream`` An instance of ``<stream>``.

Values

None.

Description

Prints ``object`` to ``stream`` by calling the ``write`` function from the
``streams`` module.
