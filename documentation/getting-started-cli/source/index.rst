Getting Started with the Open Dylan Command Line Tools
******************************************************

In Open Dylan, you can develop Dylan applications using the IDE (on
Windows) or command-line tools.

The compiler executable is called ``dylan-compiler``.  There is a helper
application called ``make-dylan-app``, which can be used to generate
some boilerplate for a new project, and finally there's ``dswank``
which is a back-end for interactive development in Emacs.  This
document describes these command-line tools.

For help getting started with the IDE on Windows, see
the `Getting Started with the Open Dylan IDE
<http://opendylan.org/documentation/getting-started-ide/>`_
guide.
