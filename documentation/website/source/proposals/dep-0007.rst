Abstract
========

To improve type safety of collections and particularly limited collections,
this DEP adds a ``default-fill:`` keyword argument to limited collection
classes and an ``element-type-fill`` and ``element-type`` getter to all
collections.


Specification
=============

The collection classes that allow a ``fill:`` keyword argument are:

- ``<array>``
- ``<vector>``
- ``<simple-vector>``
- ``<simple-object-vector>``
- ``<stretchy-vector>``
- ``<deque>``
- ``<list>``
- ``<string>``
- ``<byte-string>``
- ``<unicode-string>``

This DEP refers to these classes as *fillable collection classes*. Fillable
collection classes are comprised of all the direct and indirect subclasses of
``<mutable-sequence>`` excepting ``<mutable-sequence>`` itself, ``<pair>``, and
``<empty-list>``.


``limited``
-----------

The ``limited`` methods on fillable collection classes will each add the
following additional parameter:

====================  ==========================================
Class                 Parameter
====================  ==========================================
``<string>``          ``#key default-fill :: <character> = ' '``
``<byte-string>``     ``#key default-fill :: K1 = C1``
``<unicode-string>``  ``#key default-fill :: K2 = C2``
All others            ``#key default-fill :: <object> = #f``
====================  ==========================================

*K1* and *K2* are unspecified subclasses of ``<character>``. *C1* and *C2* are
unspecified values equivalent to a space character.

The ``limited`` methods on fillable collection classes each return a limited
type designated *L*. The ``fill:`` init-keyword of all *L* will have a default
value identical to the default value listed above instead of ``#f``.

The defaulted or supplied ``default-fill:`` argument must be an instance of the
element type of the collection; it is an error to supply a default filler
object that the collection cannot accommodate.


``element-type-fill``
---------------------

A new open generic function will be added to the Dylan library::

   element-type-fill (coll :: <collection>) => (fill-object :: <object>)

For instances of fillable collection classes returned by ``limited``, this
function will return the (possibly defaulted) ``default-fill:`` argument to
``limited``. For instances of all other fillable collection classes, this
function will return the following:

====================  ============  
Class                 Return Value
====================  ============  
``<string>``          ``' '``
``<byte-string>``     C1
``<unicode-string>``  C2
All others            ``#f``
====================  ============  

*C1* and *C2* are unspecified values equivalent to a space character.

It is an error to call ``element-type-fill`` on an instance of a collection
class that does not support the ``fill:`` init-keyword. However,
implementations may find this difficult to check (because users can introduce
that keyword in any subclass) and may return ``#f`` for such collections
instead. Portable programs should not rely on this behavior.


``element-type``
----------------

A new open generic function will be added to the Dylan library::

   element-type (coll :: <collection>) => (element-type :: <type>)

For instances of collection classes with a limited element type, this function
will return that element type. For instances of other collection classes, this
function will return the element type described in
`Element Types <http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Element_Types>`__ of the [DRM]_.


``map``, ``map-as``, etc.
-------------------------

Every function that instantiates a new collection using the first value of an
existing collection as the ``fill:`` initialization argument will instead use
the new collection's default fill argument (i.e., omit the ``fill:`` argument).


Motivation
==========

The second paragraph of the 
`Collection Operations <http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Collection_Operations>`__
section of the [DRM]_ states the following:

   Note to implementors: Functions such as ``map``, ``map-as`` that return a
   new collection cannot rely on the type they instantiate having a valid
   default for ``fill:``. Therefore, when the size of the result is nonzero,
   these functions should compute the first element of the result before making
   the collection and specify that element as the ``fill:`` value. Otherwise a
   spurious type error could occur when making the collection.
   
However, there is a problem with the ``size-setter`` method that is not
addressed by the above note. That method may be called on an empty collection
to grow it. The DRM states:

   The value of each new element is the same as would have been used if the
   stretchy sequence had been created with ``make``, specifying ``size:``
   *new-size* but not ``fill:``.

That is, new elements are the default ``fill:`` value for the collection. This
will be to ``#f``, ``0``, or ``' '`` depending on the type of limited
collection. But in a user-defined limited collection, such as
``limited(<vector>, of: <shape>)``, the default causes a spurious type error.
And if the collection is empty, the workaround described in the DRM of using
the first element of the collection cannot be used.

This DEP solves both problems. It describes a way for a collection type to
specify a valid default for ``fill:`` providing a superior alternative to the
workaround described in the DRM's note to implementors, and also describes a
way for ``size-setter`` to populate a collection with valid values.

Additionally, this DEP adds the ``element-type`` method. This method is useful
for code that transforms or manipulates one collection into a different form.
The example of the ``<stream>`` classes comes to mind. If you write code that
maps a stream to or from a user-supplied collection, that code cannot verify
compatibility between the stream's ``stream-element-type`` and the collection's
element type. Adding the ``element-type`` method solves that problem.


Rationale
=========

I named ``element-type-fill`` that rather than ``default-fill`` because the
latter name is a little more misleading. A user can define a subclass of a
collection and provide a new default value for the ``fill:`` init-keyword
without needing to define a new ``element-type-fill`` method; he only needs to
do that when restricting the element type of a collection.

The ``element-type-fill`` and ``element-type`` methods take an *instance* of a
collection class as an argument rather than the *type* of the collection. This
is necessary because the [DRM]_ allows the ``limited`` function on *C* to
return *C* itself as a type, implying that the default fill and element type
information associated with the limited collection has to be available on a
per-instance basis. Plus, creating getters on types is not idiomatic to Dylan.

I had originally considered a more extensive change where each instance of a
fillable collection class would not only track its *default* fill value, but
also track the *specific* ``fill:`` value that it was created with. But in
thinking about it, I feel the designers made the right call in leaving that
information out of each instance. In particular, the implementation of
``<list>`` would be difficult if each instance tracked its ``fill:`` value.


Implementation Notes
--------------------

``element-type``
''''''''''''''''

The Open Dylan implementation already defines this internally. The name just
needs to be exported.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This DEP does not change the limited collection type relationships described in
the `Limited Collection Types <http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Limited_Collection_Types>`__
section of the [DRM]_.

The default value of the new ``default-fill:`` parameter to ``limited`` is the
same as the previously hard-coded default value of the ``fill:`` init-parameter
to the fillable collection classes. Therefore, code that calls ``limited``
without the ``default-fill:`` argument will get a type whose default ``fill:``
value is the same as the ``fill:`` value in current versions of Open Dylan.

Existing code that relies on the first element being used as a new collection's
fill value will probably behave differently. This sort of code seems unlikely to
exist.

Existing code that uses the first element as a new collection's fill value will
work as before, but will not longer be consistent with the behavior of ``map``,
etc.

Existing subclasses of ``<collection>`` that define their own ``fill:``
init-keyword will still work, assuming they also define a default value that is
of the element type of the subclass.

New code may use ``element-type`` or ``element-type-fill`` in conjunction with
an existing subclass of ``<collection>`` with restricted types that does not
define those methods. Those functions will then return ``<object>`` and ``#f``,
which may not be appropriate for the existing collection.

The only other backwards compatibility issue is a namespace collision if the
user defines his own unrelated "element-type" or "element-type-fill" bindings.
