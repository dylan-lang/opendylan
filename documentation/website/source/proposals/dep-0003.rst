Abstract
========

The Dylan superclass linearization is sometimes counter-intuitive. The
C3 superclass linearization algorithm is more intuitive.

Specification
=============

The C3 superclass linearization has been proposed in 1996 by Kim
Barrett, Bob Cassels, Paul Haahr, David A. Moon, Keith Playford, and
P. Tucker Withington in a `paper
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/236337.236343>`_ (`html version
<http://192.220.96.201/dylan/linearizations.html>`_).

A superclass linearization (also known as a class precedence list) is
used for resolving conflicts among multiply-inherited superclasses
which provide differing definitions of the same method.

Unfortunately the algorithm presented in the Dylan Reference Manual
(`computing the class precedence list
<http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Classes#HEADING-41-25>`_) is not
consistent with the extended precedence graph, and may lead to
counter-intuitive linearizations. To fix that, C3 was developed.

Motivation
==========

In order to allow for more optimizations, especially compression of
dispatch tables, which requires monotonicity of method orderings, a
consistent superclass linearization algorithm is needed.

C3 has been proposed in 1996 and was subsequently adapted to Python
2.3 (`article <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>`__)
and Perl 6 (`article
<http://use.perl.org/~autrijus/journal/25768>`__).

Rationale
=========

C3 has been around for long enough, it does not break any existing
code, and it is the right thing to do according to the mailing list
discussions.

Examples
========

The example from the paper is given here, consider the following Dylan classes:

.. code-block:: dylan

    define class <pane> (<object>) end;
    define class <scrolling-mixin> (<object>) end;
    define class <editing-mixin> (<object>) end;
    define class <scrollable-pane> (<pane>, <scrolling-mixin>) end;
    define class <editable-pane> (<pane>, <editing-mixin>) end;
    define class <editable-scrollable-pane> (<scrollable-pane>, <editable-pane>) end;


The Dylan linearization is:
    <editable-scrollable-pane>, <scrollable-pane>, <editable-pane>, <pane>, <editing-mixin>, <scrolling-mixin>, <object>

The C3 linearization is:
    <editable-scrollable-pane>, <scrollable-pane>, <editable-pane>, <pane>, <scrolling-mixin>, <editing-mixin>, <object>


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

In the first release a serious warning will be issued for superclass
linearization which changed, in subsequent releases a warning should
be issued (depending on a strict compatibility to DRM switch).

Experiments show that there are some differences in existing code; we
found so far three, two of them in duim-gadgets, one in
win32-duim. According to Scott McKay, the author of DUIM, the first
two look better when C3 is used (`mailing list post
<https://lists.opendylan.org/pipermail/hackers/2012-January/006309.html>`_). The
latter does not alter behaviour (`post
<https://lists.opendylan.org/pipermail/hackers/2012-January/006310.html>`_).
