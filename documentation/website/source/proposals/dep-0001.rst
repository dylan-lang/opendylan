Preamble
========

This document is based heavily on Python PEP 1, "PEP Purpose and
Guidelines", by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger.  The
author would like to thank them for providing an excellent base for
the Dylan team to work from.


What is a DEP?
==============

DEP stands for Dylan Enhancement Proposal.  A DEP is a design
document providing information to the Dylan community, or describing
a new feature for Dylan or its processes or environment.  The DEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend DEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Dylan.  The DEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the DEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.


DEP Types
=========

There are three kinds of DEP:

1. A **Standards Track** DEP describes a new feature or implementation
   for Dylan.

2. An **Informational** DEP describes a Dylan design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the Dylan community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational DEPs do not
   necessarily represent a Dylan community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
   Informational DEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** DEP describes a process surrounding Dylan, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process DEPs are
   like Standards Track DEPs but apply to areas other than the Dylan
   language itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   Dylan's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational DEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in Dylan development.
   Any meta-DEP is also considered a Process DEP.


DEP Work Flow
=============

The DEP process begins with a new idea for Dylan.  It is highly
recommended that a single DEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a DEP and can be
injected into the Dylan development work flow with a patch submission
to the issue tracker for the appropriate repository on GitHub. The
more focussed the DEP, the more successful it tends to be.  If in
doubt, split your DEP into several well-focussed ones.

Each DEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the DEP using the
style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around
the idea.  The DEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to
ascertain whether the idea is DEP-able.  Posting to
hackers@opendylan.org is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a DEP is meant
to save the potential author time.  Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing Dylan that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the Dylan community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not
mean it will work for most people in most areas where Dylan is used.

Once the champion has asked the Dylan community whether an idea has
any chance of acceptance, a properly formatted draft DEP should be
presented to hackers@opendylan.org.  The initial DEP status should be
"Draft".  The DEP author should assign the next available DEP number
to the DEP by looking at the `DEP directory <index.html>`_ to find the
highest used number.  The DEP number is not assured until the DEP has
been committed to the `origin Git repository
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/website/tree/master/source/proposals>`_.
As updates are necessary, the DEP author may commit new versions.

Because Dylan does not have a Benevolent Dictator for Life (as Python
has in Guido van Rossum) we rely on reaching consensus on the hackers
mailing list.  Consensus _must_ be reached for the DEP to be approved.
Exactly what "consensus" means here is left undefined, as we expect
most cases to be obvious and we wish to keep the process informal for
now.  At such time as this becomes a problem we may implement a more
formal scheme (e.g., voting).

Standards Track DEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  The DEP should be reviewed and accepted
before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference
implementation will aid people in studying the DEP.  Standards Track
DEPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch,
or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

DEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a DEP
before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long
open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.
Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a
separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the DEP author accept
private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page,
etc.  DEP authors should use their discretion here.

For a DEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not unduly add
complication.

Once a DEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the community, the status may be changed to "Final".

A DEP can also be assigned status "Deferred".  The DEP author or
editor can assign the DEP this status when no progress is being made
on the DEP.  Once a DEP is deferred, the DEP editor can re-assign it
to draft status.

A DEP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact.

DEPs can also be superseded by a different DEP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational DEPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of DEPs are as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/dep-0001-states.png

Some Informational and Process DEPs may also have a status of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. DEP 1 (this DEP).


What belongs in a successful DEP?
=================================

Each DEP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   DEP, including the DEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Copyright/public domain -- Each DEP must either be explicitly
   labelled as placed in the public domain (see this DEP as an
   example) or licensed under the `Open Publication License`_.

4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new language feature.  The
   specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
   interoperable implementations for any of the current Dylan
   platforms.

5. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for DEPs that want to
   change the Dylan language.  It should clearly explain why the
   existing language specification is inadequate to address the
   problem that the DEP solves.

6. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design
   decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
   were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
   in other languages.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

7. Backwards Compatibility -- All DEPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity.  The DEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

8. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any DEP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the DEP is accepted.  It is better to finish
   the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it
   before writing code.

   The final implementation must include good test code and
   documentation.


DEP Format and Templates
========================

DEPs must be written in ReStructuredText_ format.  This allows for
rich markup that is still quite easy to read, but results in much
better-looking and more functional HTML.

.. DEP 12 contains instructions and a template [4]_ for
   reStructuredText DEPs.

The DEP author must verify that the ReStructuredText_ parses correctly.
For example::

    git clone git@github.com:dylan-lang/website.git
    cd website
    cp your-dep.rst source/proposals/dep-1234.rst
    make html

Fix any errors that are displayed.


DEP Header Preamble
===================

Each DEP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble in simple
RST table format.  The headers must appear in the following order.
Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below.  All
other headers are required. ::

    DEP: <DEP number>
    Title: <DEP title>
    Version: <git revision string>
    Last-Modified: <git date string>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  * Requires: <DEP numbers>
    Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
  * Dylan-Version: <version number>
    Post-History: <dates of postings to hackers list>
  * Replaces: <DEP number>
  * Superseded-By: <DEP number>
  * Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the DEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

.. Not yet: Note that personal email addresses in DEPs will be
   obscured as a defense against spam harvesters.

*Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track DEPs
only.  It contains a URL that should point to an email message or
other web resource where the pronouncement about the DEP is made.*

The Type header specifies the type of DEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the DEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the DEP are posted to the hackers list.  Both
headers should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2001.

Standards Track DEPs must have a Dylan-Version header which indicates
the version of Dylan that the feature will be released with.
Informational and Process DEPs do not need a Dylan-Version header.

DEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the DEP numbers that this
DEP depends on.

DEPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a DEP has
been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of
the DEP that replaces the current document.  The newer DEP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the DEP that it rendered
obsolete.


Auxiliary Files
===============

DEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files must be
named ``pep-XXXX-aaaa.ext``, where "XXXX" is the DEP number, "aaaa" is
arbitrary text to indicate the file content (e.g., "state-diagram"),
and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").


Reporting DEP Bugs, or Submitting DEP Updates
=============================================

How you report a bug, or submit a DEP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the DEP, the preferences of the DEP
author, and the nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages
of the DEP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the DEP author.  For more mature, or finished DEPs you may
want to submit corrections to the Dylan `issue tracker`_ so that your
changes don't get lost.  Assign the bug/patch to the DEP author.

When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the DEP author.

DEP authors who are also Dylan committers can update the DEPs
themselves committing them to Git and pushing to the main repository.


DEP Author Responsibilities & Workflow
======================================

A DEP author must subscribe to the <hackers@opendylan.org> list.
Before submitting a (new revision of a DEP) the author must do the
following:

* Read the DEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Edit the DEP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
  etc.), markup, and code style.

Once the DEP is ready for the repository, the DEP author will:

* Assign the next available DEP number.

* List the DEP in the DEP index (in two places: the categorized list,
  and the numeric list).

* Add the DEP to Git.  All DEPs live in `the website repository
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/website>`_.  The command to check
  it out is::

    git clone git@github.com:dylan-lang/website.git

  Commit your changes, push them to your fork of the repository and
  submit a pull request.

* Monitor opendylan.org to make sure the DEP gets added to the site
  properly.

* See the section `For Open Dylan Developers
  <http://opendylan.org/documentation/index.html>`_ on the opendylan.org
  documentation page.

   DEP.  For language changes, changes to Open Dylan, or changes to
   "core" libraries it will usually be `opendylan
   <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues>`_.  For other
   libraries there may be a separate repository and issue tracker.
   This is still in flux.  When in doubt, ask in IRC on the #dylan
