Preamble
========

This document is based heavily on Python PEP 1, "PEP Purpose and
Guidelines", by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger.  The
author would like to thank them for providing an excellent base for
the Dylan team to work from.


What is a DEP?
==============

DEP stands for Dylan Enhancement Proposal.  A DEP is a design document
which

  * provides information to the Dylan community, or
  * describes a new feature for the Dylan language or its standard
    libraries, or
  * describes changes to the processes or environment surrounding
    Dylan or its reference implementation, Open Dylan.

The DEP should provide a concise technical specification of, and
rationale for, the feature or process.

We intend DEPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Dylan.  The DEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the DEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.


DEP Types
=========

There are three kinds of DEP:

1. A **Standards Track** DEP describes a new feature or implementation
   for Dylan or its standard libraries.

2. An **Informational** DEP describes a Dylan design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the Dylan community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational DEPs do not
   necessarily represent a Dylan community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
   Informational DEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** DEP describes a process surrounding Dylan, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process DEPs are
   like Standards Track DEPs but apply to areas other than the Dylan
   language itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   Dylan's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational DEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in Dylan development.
   Any meta-DEP is also considered a Process DEP.


DEP Work Flow
=============

**Have an idea** -- The DEP process begins with a new idea for Dylan.
It is highly recommended that a single DEP contain a **single key
proposal** or new idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need
a DEP and can be injected into the Dylan development work flow with a
patch submission to the issue tracker for the appropriate repository
on GitHub. The more focussed the DEP, the more successful it tends to
be.  If in doubt, split your DEP into several well-focussed ones.

**Have a champion** -- Each DEP must have a champion -- someone who
writes the DEP using the style and format described below, shepherds
the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build
community consensus around the idea.  The DEP champion (a.k.a. Author)
should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is DEP-able.
Posting to hackers@opendylan.org is the best way to go about this.

**Vet the idea publicly** -- Vetting an idea publicly before going as
far as writing a DEP is meant to save the potential author time.  Many
ideas have been brought forward for changing Dylan that have been
rejected for various reasons. Asking the Dylan community first if an
idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something
that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions
(searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps
to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not
just the author.  Just because an idea sounds good to the author does
not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Dylan is
used.

**Present a draft** -- Once the champion has asked the Dylan community
whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a properly formatted
draft DEP should be presented to hackers@opendylan.org.  The initial
DEP status should be **Draft**.  The DEP author should assign the next
available DEP number to the DEP by looking at the `DEP directory
<index.html>`_ to find the highest used number.  The DEP number is not
assured until the DEP has been committed to the `origin Git repository
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/website/tree/master/source/proposals>`_.
As updates are necessary, the DEP author may commit new versions.

Wait for at least two weeks to receive feedback on each draft.

**Reach consensus** -- We rely on reaching consensus on the hackers
mailing list.  Consensus _must_ be reached for the DEP to be approved.
Exactly what "consensus" means here is left undefined, as we expect
most cases to be obvious and we wish to keep the process informal for
now.  At such time as this becomes a problem we may implement a more
formal scheme (e.g., voting).

Standards Track DEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  The DEP should be reviewed and accepted
before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference
implementation will aid people in studying the DEP.  Standards Track
DEPs must include an implementation -- in the form of a Git branch URL
-- before it can be considered Final.

DEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a DEP
before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long
open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.
Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a
separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the DEP author accept
private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page,
etc.  DEP authors should use their discretion here.

For a DEP to be **Accepted** it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not unduly add
complication.

Once a DEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the community, the status may be changed to **Final**.

A DEP can also be assigned status **Deferred**.  The DEP author or
editor can assign the DEP this status when no progress is being made
on the DEP.  Once a DEP is deferred, the DEP editor can re-assign it
to draft status.

A DEP can also be **Rejected**.  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact.

DEPs can also be **superseded by** a different DEP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational DEPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of DEPs are as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/dep-0001-states.png

Some Informational and Process DEPs may also have a status of
**Active** if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. DEP 1 (this
DEP).


What belongs in a successful DEP?
=================================

Each DEP should have the following parts:

1. Title

#. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   DEP, including the DEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

#. Table of contents::

     .. contents: Contents
        :local:

#. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

#. Copyright/public domain -- Each DEP must either be explicitly
   labelled as placed in the public domain (see this DEP as an
   example) or licensed under the `Open Publication License`_.

#. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new language or library feature.  The
   specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
   interoperable Dylan implementations.  If the DEP proposes changes
   to the language itself it *must* clearly indicate all such changes.

#. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for DEPs that want to
   change the Dylan language.  It should clearly explain why the
   existing language specification is inadequate to address the
   problem that the DEP solves.

#. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design
   decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
   were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
   in other languages.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

#. Backwards Compatibility -- All DEPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity.  The DEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

#. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any DEP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the DEP is accepted.  It is better to finish
   the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it
   before writing code.

   The final implementation must include good test code and
   documentation.


DEP Format and Templates
========================

DEPs must be written in ReStructuredText_ format.  This allows for
rich markup that is still quite easy to read, but results in much
better-looking and more functional HTML.

.. DEP 12 contains instructions and a template [4]_ for
   reStructuredText DEPs.

The DEP author must verify that the ReStructuredText_ parses correctly.
For example::

    git clone git@github.com:dylan-lang/website.git
    cd website
    cp your-dep.rst source/proposals/dep-1234.rst
    make html

Fix any errors that are displayed.


DEP Header Preamble
===================

Each DEP must begin with a title, followed by an RFC 822 style header
preamble in simple RST table format.  The headers must appear in the
following order.  Headers marked with "*" are optional and are
described below.  All other headers are required.  All dates must
be in dd-mm-yyyy format.  ::

    DEP-Number: <DEP number>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
    Affects-DRM: Yes/No
    Created: <date created>
    Last-Modified: <date last modified>
    Post-History: <dates of postings to hackers list>
    Resolution: <url>   [required for Standards Track DEPs only]
  * Target-Version: <OD version number>
  * Requires: <DEP numbers>
  * Replaces: <DEP number>
  * Superseded-By: <DEP number>

DEP Number
~~~~~~~~~~

Authors may assign DEP numbers themselves by looking at the last
number in the `numerical list of DEPs
<http://opendylan.org/proposals/index.html>`_ and incrementing it by
one.  To prevent collisions, the author should set the ``DEP-Number``
header to "Unassigned" until just before the DEP is committed to git.

Author
~~~~~~

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the DEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

.. Not yet: Note that personal email addresses in DEPs will be
   obscured as a defense against spam harvesters.

Status
~~~~~~

See `DEP Work Flow`_ for a description of this field.

Type
~~~~

The Type header specifies the type of DEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

Affects-DRM
~~~~~~~~~~~

This field is only required for Standards Track DEPs.  The value
should be **Yes** if the DEP proposes a change to the Dylan language
definition, and otherwise **No**.  The language definition is composed
of the Dylan Reference Manual plus any **Accepted** DEPs for which
this field is **Yes**.  If this field is set to **Yes** then the DEP
*must* clearly list exactly how it affects the language definition.

Created
~~~~~~~

The Created header records the date that the DEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the DEP are posted to the hackers list.  Both headers
should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2001.

Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~

The Resolution header is required for Standards Track DEPs only.  It
contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web
resource where the pronouncement about the DEP is made.

Target-Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standards Track DEPs must have a Target-Version header which indicates
the version of Open Dylan in which the feature is expected to be
released.  Informational and Process DEPs do not need a Target-Version
header.

Requires
~~~~~~~~

DEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the DEP numbers that this
DEP depends on.

Superseded-By and Replaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DEPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that they have
been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of
the DEP that replaces the current document.  The newer DEP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the DEP that it rendered
obsolete.


Auxiliary Files
===============

DEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files must be
named ``dep-XXXX-aaaa.ext``, where "XXXX" is the DEP number (padded
with leading zeros), "aaaa" is arbitrary text to indicate the file
content (e.g., "state-diagram"), and "ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. "png").


Reporting DEP Bugs, or Submitting DEP Updates
=============================================

How you report a bug, or submit a DEP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the DEP, the preferences of the DEP
author, and the nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages
of the DEP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the DEP author.  For more mature, or finished DEPs you may
want to submit corrections to the Dylan issue tracker [2]_ so that your
changes don't get lost.  Assign the bug/patch to the DEP author.

When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the DEP author.

DEP authors who are also Dylan committers can update the DEPs
themselves committing them to Git and pushing to the main repository.


DEP Author Responsibilities & Workflow
======================================

A DEP author must subscribe to the <hackers@opendylan.org> list.
Before submitting a (new revision of a DEP) the author must do the
following:

* Read the DEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Edit the DEP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
  etc.), markup, and code style.

Once the DEP is ready for the repository, the DEP author will:

* Assign the next available DEP number.

* List the DEP in the DEP index (in two places: the categorized list,
  and the numeric list).

* Add the DEP to Git.  All DEPs live in `the website repository
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/website>`_.  The command to check
  it out is::

    git clone git@github.com:dylan-lang/website.git

  Commit your changes, push them to your fork of the repository and
  submit a pull request.

* Monitor opendylan.org to make sure the DEP gets added to the site
  properly.

Resources:

* See the section `For Open Dylan Developers
  <http://opendylan.org/documentation/index.html>`_ on the opendylan.org
  documentation page.

.. It would be nice to have equivalents for some of these:

    * `How Dylan is Developed <http://www.python.org/dev/intro/>`_

    * `Dylan's Development Process <http://www.python.org/dev/process/>`_

    * `Why Develop Dylan? <http://www.python.org/dev/why/>`_

    * `Development Tools <http://www.python.org/dev/tools/>`_

    * `Frequently Asked Questions for Developers
      <http://www.python.org/dev/faq/>`_

.. [2] Which issue tracker to use will depend on the content of the
   DEP.  For language changes, changes to Open Dylan, or changes to
   "core" libraries it will usually be `opendylan
   <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues>`_.  For other
   libraries there may be a separate repository and issue tracker.
   This is still in flux.  When in doubt, ask in IRC on the #dylan
