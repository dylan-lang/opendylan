New command-line-parser Library
===============================

The <https://github.com/dylan-lang/command-line-parser>`_ library has
been completely rewritten to

  * be far less verbose
  * have simplified usage
  * have automatic support for --help
  * be documented

Testworks and the HTTP server are using the new library.  More
enhancements coming soon.
