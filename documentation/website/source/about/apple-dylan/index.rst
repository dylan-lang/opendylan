Apple Dylan
***********

*Apple Dylan* was a first run of `Apple Computer, Inc.
<http://www.apple.com/>`_ at an integrated development environment for
the Dylan language. It appeared as a technology release in 1995 for the
MC68k platform. It had numerous flaws, mainly that it was built on the
top of the MCL (Macintosh Common Lisp from `Digitool
<http://www.digitool.com/>`_) development environment. Although this
made it a wonderful environment, it was a severe restriction on further
progress. Because Apple got into serious financial trouble that time,
they had to stop Dylan development and dissolved the
:doc:`apple-cambridge` team. In a final act Digitool was funded to do a
port to the PowerPC platform. The result of this (with some patches)
still runs on MacOS 9.2 (but not in the "Classic" compatibility box
under Mac OS X).

Apple Dylan TR does not implement all of Dylan; macro support especially
is rudimentary. Otherwise it is an awesome IDE, probably the best
around, despite the fact that it is 8 years old.

Paul R Potts was an Apple Dylan beta tester, and has written several
pages detailing his experiences and impressions:

- :doc:`eulogy` - a few words on Apple Dylan
- :doc:`technology-release` - about the prototype
- :doc:`today` - can I still run it?
- :doc:`screenshots/index` - the configurable browser
- :doc:`screenshots/browsers`- the special browsers
- :doc:`screenshots/dynamic` - the dynamic environment
- :doc:`screenshots/misc` - the interface builder, and Lisp leftovers
