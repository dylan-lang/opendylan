Apple Cambridge
***************

In the 1990's Apple Computer acquired Coral Software. Coral originally
developed a capable Lisp environment for the Apple Macintosh that
eclipsed the half-hearted competitors such as ExperLisp. Soon it
achieved Common Lisp compliance, and was later renamed Macintosh Common
Lisp (MCL). MCL became the foundation for some exciting technology that
came out of ATG, such as `SK8 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK8>`_ and
:doc:`index`.

Under the direction of Ike Nassi, Apple Cambridge developed Apple Dylan,
initially for the Newton PDA, and subsequently for the Apple Macintosh.

Apple Cambridge was disbanded in 1995. Several members of group went on
to work on Harlequin Dylan, and later at Functional Objects.
