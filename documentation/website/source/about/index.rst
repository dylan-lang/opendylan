From `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_(programming_language)>`_:

    Dylan is a multi-paradigm programming language that includes support for
    functional and object-oriented programming, and is dynamic while providing
    a programming model designed to support efficient machine code generation,
    including fine-grained control over dynamic and static behaviors. It was
    created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer.

    Dylan derives from Scheme and Common Lisp and adds an integrated object
    system derived from the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). In Dylan, all
    values (including numbers, characters, functions, and classes) are
    first-class objects. Dylan supports multiple inheritance, polymorphism,
    multiple dispatch, keyword arguments, object introspection, pattern-based
    syntax extension macros, and many other advanced features. Programs can
    express fine-grained control over dynamism, admitting programs that
    occupy a continuum between dynamic and static programming and supporting
    evolutionary development (allowing for rapid prototyping followed by
    incremental refinement and optimization).

    Dylan's main design goal is to be a dynamic language well-suited for
    developing commercial software. Dylan attempts to address potential
    performance issues by introducing "natural" limits to the full
    flexibility of Lisp systems, allowing the compiler to clearly understand
    compilable units (i.e., libraries).

    Although deriving much of its semantics from Scheme and other Lisps —
    some implementations were in fact initially built within existing
    Lisp systems—Dylan has an ALGOL-like syntax rather than a
    Scheme-like prefix syntax.
