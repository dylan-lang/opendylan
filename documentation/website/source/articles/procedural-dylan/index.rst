Procedural Dylan
================

or How to write Pascal programs in Dylan
----------------------------------------

Dylan is promoted as an object-oriented, dynamic language, but it also
offers a rich set of constructs for programming in other styles. This
essay explores Dylan from the perspective of a programmer used to
traditional procedural languages, such as Pascal or C, who may want to
use the facilities offered by Dylan development environments without
changing programming style or thinking in a different way. Also, some
features of Dylan which mesh well with the procedural programming style
but have no direct analogs in Pascal or C may make an appropriate
addition to one's bag of tricks.

This essay is intended to be used as a tutorial introduction and not as
a complete reference work. To avoid bogging down the discussion, much
has been omitted and some details have been ignored. For more complete
information, see the `Dylan Reference Manual </books/drm/>`__.
