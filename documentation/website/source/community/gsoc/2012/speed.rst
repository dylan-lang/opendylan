Speed

The purpose of this project is to implement a number of benchmarks in
Dylan and provide infrastructure for recording and observing performance
data over time.

Inspiration (and benchmark ideas) can be borrowed from:

- `pypy speed center <http://speed.pypy.org/>`_
- `Boinkmarks <http://sbcl.boinkor.net/boinkmarks/index>`_
- `microbench for numerics in CL <https://github.com/nikodemus/microbench>`_
