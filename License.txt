	       FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS LIBRARY PUBLIC LICENSE
                              Version 1.0
________________________________________________________________________

Preamble.

This license permits the use and distribution of the source code for
certain Functional Objects libraries under terms intended to satisfy the Open
Source Definition (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html).

This license sets the terms and conditions for distribution of these
libraries either:
- as source code, or
- as compiled libraries for use with programs such as development tools.

These terms and conditions require, among other things, that any such
distribution involve the preservation of the copyright notice and
license terms, identification of all modifications, and a declaration of
no warranty.  They also provide for use of Functional Objects' trade names and
trade marks in any distribution and govern their use in any advertising,
publicity, or other such public use.

This license allows the distribution of these libraries in binary form
without requiring the distribution of source code, provided such
libraries are distributed as part of a larger application, other than
development tools, as further set forth below.  In this respect it is
unlike most open source agreements, which require that the source be
made available with all binary distributions.

You are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
any code, library, or any derivative works thereof. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this license. Therefore, by
using, modifying or distributing any code, library (or any work based on
the code), you indicate your acceptance of the License set forth below,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
such Code, library, or works based on them.


1. Definitions. 

1.1. "Contributor" means each entity that creates or contributes to the
creation of Modifications.

1.2. "Contributor Version" means the combination of the Original Code,
prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made by
that particular Contributor.

1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code or Modifications or the
combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
including portions thereof.

1.4. "Deploy" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other
than for Your internal research and development (R&D), and includes
without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered
Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use, as well as
direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You
to any third party in any form or manner.

1.5. "Developer" means Functional Objects, Inc., or its affiliates or
licensors, as applicable.

1.6. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism generally
accepted in the software development community for the electronic
transfer of data.

1.7. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source Code.

1.8. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions
thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License. There are
two forms of Larger Work relevant to this license:

     A. A work that Uses Covered Code means software that contains no
     derivative of any portion of the Covered Code, but is designed to
     work with the Covered Code by being compiled or linked with it, and
     is not and has no ability to link to other application programs.

     B. A work that Includes Covered Code means any other work,
     including, but not limited to, one that is intended to make Covered
     Code available as a Library to users of the Larger Work, whether by
     aggregation, re-export of functionality, or any other method.

1.9. "Library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be linked with application programs (which use some of
those functions and data) to form executables.

1.10. "License" means this document.

1.11. "Licensable" means having the right to grant, to the maximum
extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or
subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights conveyed herein

1.12. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the
substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
Modification is:

      A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
      containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

      B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or
      previous Modifications.

      C. Any new file that extends the operation of the Covered Code, as
      part of the same Library.

1.13. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code
identified under this License, excluding Modifications.

1.14. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned or hereafter
acquired, including without limitation, method, process, and apparatus
claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.

1.15. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source code
differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
well-known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
for no charge.

1.16. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising
rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a
future version of this License issued under Section 5.1. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with You. For purposes of this definition,
"control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.


2. Source Code License. 

2.1. License Grant. 
The Developer and each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
property claims:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with
or without Modifications, alone and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for
sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions
thereof).

(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on
the date Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of
this License.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted:
1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the
Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of
the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other
software or devices.

2.2. Contributor Grant. 
Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
 
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor
(or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that
Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination).

(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on
the date Contributor first Deploys the Covered Code.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:
1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor
Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements
caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)
the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices;
or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of
Modifications made by that Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Application of License. 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 5.1, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any distribution of Covered Code as a Library, or as part of a Larger
Work that Includes the Covered Code, must include the full Source Code
for that Covered Code under the terms of this License either on the same
media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the
Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications. 
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided by the Developer and including the name of the Developer in (a)
the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of
the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 

(a) Third Party Claims. 
If Contributor has knowledge that a party claims an intellectual
property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
under this License), Contributor must include a text file with the
source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs. 
If Contributor's Modification is an application programming interface
and Contributor owns or controls patents which are reasonably necessary
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in
the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations. 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a), Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in a location (such as a
relevant directory file, or a library specification file, or in every
file of the source code) where a user would be likely to look for such a
notice. You must duplicate this License in any documentation for the
Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
Code.  If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name
as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You may choose
to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
of the Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear
than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity, liability
or other additional terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only as part of a
Larger Work that Uses the Covered Code without restriction.  Otherwise
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
only if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights
set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
the Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Developer and every Contributor for any damages or liability incurred by
the Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
offer.

3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.


4. Application of this License. 

This License applies to code to which the Developer has attached the
notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the code
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the code is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
such parties remain in full compliance.


5. Versions of the License. 

5.1. New Versions. 
Functional Objects, Inc. ("Functional Objects") may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
be given a distinguishing version number.

5.2. Effect of New Versions. 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by Functional
Objects. No one other than Functional Objects has the right to modify
the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

5.3. Derivative Works. 
If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrase Functional Objects or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
Functional Objects Library Public License.


6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT
THE DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.


7. TERMINATION. 

7.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

7.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Developer or a
Contributor (the Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing
to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version
against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing
by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
and/or 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

7.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

7.4. In the event of termination under Sections 7.1 or 7.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.


8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


9. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 

All Covered Code is commercial computer software program developed at
private expense and is subject to the following Restricted Rights
Legend: "Use, duplication, or disclosure by the United States Government
is subject to restrictions as set forth in (i) FAR 52.227-14 Alt III or
(ii) FAR 52.227-19, as applicable.  Use by agencies of the Department of
Defense (DOD) is subject to Functional Objects' customary commercial license
terms, contained in this License, in accordance with DFAR 227.7202-1
(a).  For purposes of the FAR, the Software shall be deemed to
'unpublished' and licensed with disclosure prohibitions, rights reserved
under the copyright laws of the United States.  Functional Objects, Inc.,
86 Chandler Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144."


10. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflicts of law
provisions.  The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.


11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 

Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues
you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You
agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an
equitable basis.


12. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. 

Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
"Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Developer
permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of
the HLPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Developer
as described in Exhibit A.

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!
