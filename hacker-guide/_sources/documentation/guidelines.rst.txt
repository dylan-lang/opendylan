Gender
======

Try to avoid all gender-specific pronouns. In preference, use third person
plural pronouns such as "they", "their", "them".

Tense
=====

Use simple present tense unless there is a clear need to do
otherwise. Specifically, don't use future tense to describe what a
function **will** do, describe what it **does**.
