Writing Documentation
*********************

We are working on a tool to automatically generate skeletal documentation from
source code, but until then, we are documenting the Open Dylan libraries
manually using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to build the HTML pages.
Sphinx uses reStructuredText markup with some extensions of its own, and we have
created additional extensions to document Dylan language entities.

The documentation — a number of RST files — is in the `OpenDylan
documentation
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/tree/master/documentation>`_
directory. Consult the Sphinx web-site for details about
reStructuredText markup and Sphinx extensions to it, and see the
`Dylan sphinx-extensions documentation
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/sphinx-extensions/tree/master/sphinxcontrib/dylan/domain>`_
repository for details about the Dylan language extensions. (You may
use the ``rst2html`` tool to generate an HTML page from an ``.rst``
file.)
