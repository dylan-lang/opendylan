 * This file defines a temporary interface between the Dylan run-time
 * system and the Memory Pool System (MPS).  It is
 * only here to make initial integration with Dylan easier
 * by removing some of the burden from the Dylan Group.  The
 * Dylan run-time system should migrate to the full MPS Interface
 * as soon as possible.
 *
 * The interface code internally defines a descriptor for the Dylan
 * object format.

/* Allocation Error Handler Type
 *
 * Each allocation or reservation function defined below has a
 * corresponding error handler which is called if the allocation fails for
 * some reason.  The error handler is passed the error code (defined
 * above), a string containing the identifier of the operation which
 * failed (e.g. "MMReserveWrapper") and the size of the request which failed.
 *
 * If the error handler returns, NULL is returned from the
 * operation which failed.  Alternatively, the error handler may
 * perform a longjmp to abort the operation entirely.  The error handler
 * may _not_ allocate memory from the memory manager.

/* Allocate Space for a Dylan Object
 *
 * MMReserveObject allocates space on the main Dylan heap which is
 * managed by a garbage collection policy.  It returns a pointer
 * to an area of memory large anough to accommodate an object of
 * the size requested.  This memory must be initialized with an
 * object in the DylanWorks Contaner Format (design.dylan.container),
 * and then MMCommitObject must be called.  MMCommitObject is passed
 * the pointer previously returned by Reserve, and the size previously
 * passed to Reserve.  If Commit returns a non-zero (true) result then
 * the allocation succeeded and the new object may be used.  Otherwise
 * the allocation failed, the object is voided, and the reserved
 * memory must not be touched.  If you need the object, make another
 * attempt at allocation.
 *
 * Typically, the allocation sequence will be of this form:
 *
 *   do {
 *     object = MMReserveObject(size, teb);
 *     initialize(object, ...);
 *   } while(!MMCommitObject(object, size, teb));
 *
 * MMReserveObjectHandler installs an error handler for use by
 * MMReserveObject in case of error.  (See the description of error
 * handlers above.)  It returns the previously installed handler.
 * Initially, a default handler is installed which prints a message
 * on the standard error stream and calls abort().
 *
 * If you install an error handler which might return, then you must
 * test for a NULL return from MMReserveObject.  For example:
 *
 *   do {
 *     object = MMReserveObject(size, teb);
 *     if(object == NULL) break;
 *     initialize(object, ...);
 *   } while(!MMCommitObject(object, size, teb));
 *
 * Dylan object wrappers may _NOT_ be allocated using this method.
 * Use MMReserveWrapper and MMCommitWrapper instead.
 *
 * Similarly, weak tables may _NOT_ be allocated in this way.
 * MMReserveExactAWL, MMCommitExactAWL, MMReserveWeakAWL, MMCommitWeakAWL
 * should be used instead.
 * 
 * Wrappers may not be initialised to contain references to allocated
 * objects.  It may however be updated to contain such a reference, but
 * only after the call to MMCommitWrapper.

 *
 * MMRootAmbig declares that [base, limit) is a word-aligned array of

 * MMRootExact similarly declares exact references.
 *

 *  - an area declared by MMRootStatic,
 *  - the current stack,
 *  - the base address of a committed object (see MMCommitObject),
 *  - the base address of a committed wrapper (see MMCommitWrapper).
 * The garbage collector may check this condition.
