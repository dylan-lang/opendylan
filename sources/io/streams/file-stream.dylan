// File streams basically to not inherit any significant methods from
// <single-buffered-stream> or <positionable-stream>, only protocol.
// This is because they use power of two sized buffers which are aligned with
// disk segments.  <single-buffered-stream> uses non-aligned buffers
// because it has to allow for non-positionable streams as well as
// positionable ones.  File streams are positionable.  Combining aligned
// buffers with non- positionable streams is painful. In particular
// non-positionable input-output streams are pathological.
// Non-positionable input and output streams don't really need specifically
// aligned buffers, as long as the buffer sizes are well chosen they will
// in fact remain aligned.  So it is simpler just to implement aligned
// positionable buffered streams for <file-stream>.
