//      class-instance  - A <remote-value> pointing to the <class>.
//    Outputs:
//      (Three parallel sequences)
//      basic-names     - A sequence of <string> objects: the slot names.
//      descriptors     - The slot descriptors themselves (as <remote-value>s).
//      values          - The current values being stored.

///// DYLAN-CLASS-BROWSER-INFORMATION
//    A new inspection API that is based on a class, rather than an instance
//    of a class. Returns summary information about how instances of the
//    class should be browsed.
//    Inputs:
//      application     - The <debug-target> tether object.
//      class-instance  - A remote value pointing to a <class> object.
//    Outputs:
//      slots           - A sequence of <pair> object. The head of each
//                        pair is a <string> representing the name of the
//                        slot. The tail is an <integer> giving the
//                        offset of the slot in <remote-value> sized units.
//      navigation     -  A <string-table> keyed on slot names, and mapping
//                        to the offset.
//      repeat         -  If the class has a repeated slot, this gives the
//                        name, otherwise is returned as #f.
//      count-offset   -  If the class has a repeated slot, this returns the
//                        offset at which the element count may be found.
//      element-size   -  Returns an integer giving the byte-size of each
//                        element for those cases where the elements are not
//                        <remote-value>-sized. If this is #f, then the 
//                        elements are all "standard" dylan objects.
//      element-offset -  If the class has a repeated slot, this returns the
//                        offset at which the 0th element can be found.
//      class-slot-count  If the class has any class-allocation slots
//                        associated with it, this returns the count.
