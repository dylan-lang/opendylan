DUIM specification outline -- July 22 1996

Version History:
 1.0: Original (now in outline.text.jan29)
 1.1: New library organization
 1.2: Random cleanups
 1.3: Clean up some naming conventions, especially for gadgets
 1.4: Bring fully up to date as of May 1
 1.5: Upgrade all class superclasses and initargs, and all function argument and
      returned value lists using a tool that gets the information from a running
      DUIM image (previous version in outline-1-4.text)
 1.6: Flush excess bits of notification protocols from the API, and simplify a
      few other odds and ends

This document is meant to serve as an outline for a DUIM specification.	 There
are no descriptions for any functions or classes to be found here.  There are no
helpful descriptions, no motivational material, and no examples.  Nonetheless,
this might still be useful to people other than the DUIM implementors.

The functionality is broken into a number of libraries, and each library is
broken into a user-level API module and an internal implementation module.
About 2/3 of the functionality is in the user API.  Only DUIM core and back-end
implementors need to worry about the remaining 1/3.

For the signatures of the functions, we have tried to use argument names and
return value names that convey useful type information.

A small amount of effort has been made to indicate where classes are sealed vs.
open, abstract vs. concrete, etc.  Unlike the defaults in Dylan itself, classes
and generic functions should be assume to be open.  When a class is designated
to be concrete, it is also instantiable.

We have also used the terms "Base class" and "Mixin class".  Base classes are
open abstract classes that are intended to provide the basic implementation for
larger protocols.  Mixin classes are open abstract classes that provide bits of
additional functionality.  The mixin classes obviously exist to provide methods
for various generic functions, but none of these methods are documented here.

There are a still a few small things missing:
 - Drag&drop is not modelled
 - Cut&paste (the clipboard) is not modelled

We have also done a fair amount of rationality checking on the overall design,
but this task is not yet fully completed in detail.  In particular, although we
paid attention to a number of other toolkits when designing DUIM, we need to go
back and be sure we really covered them.  They are:
 - the UI components of MFC
 - Tcl/Tk
 - Fresco
 - Java's UI library
 - CAPI/GP/Color (part of LispWorks)

We need to be sure the UI component of OLE (in particular, OCX's) is fully
modelled.  The main missing thing here is to make "command loops" be first class
objects, so that we can model menu-bar merging.


OVERVIEW

The Dylan User Interface Manager (DUIM) is a Dylan-based programming interface
that provides a layered set of portable facilities for constructing user
interfaces.  The core layers include:
 - a basic geometry modelling layer, which includes points, boxes, and 2-d
   affine transforms
 - a "drawing context" modelling layer, which includes colors, palettes, pens,
   brushes, text styles, and images
 - the "silica" layer, which models windows, drawing surfaces, displays, events,
   pointers (e.g., the mouse), cursors
 - a graphics layers, which includes figure-based and path-based drawing functions,
   and pixmaps
 - the "layout" layer, which provides a set of layout panes, such as rows,
   columns, tables, and "pinboards"
 - the gadget layer, which models most common user interface gadgets, such as
   buttons, radio and check boxes, sliders, scroll bars, text fields, menus and
   menu bars, tool bars, status bars, list and tree controls, and so forth
 - the frames layer, which models top-level and embedded application "frames",
   documents, commands and command tables, dialogs, and property sheets

Additional separately loadable layers include
 - an extended geometry modelling layer, which includes line and polylines,
   rectangles and polygons, and arcs and ellipses
 - a portable gadget layer, which provides implementations for some gadget
   classes that are not universally available (such as spin boxes and tree
   controls)
 - output recording, which can be used to maintain a "display list" for graphics
   done to an output recording window

While DUIM provides an API to user interface facilities for the Dylan
application programmer, it is not itself a window system toolkit.  DUIM uses the
service of the underlying window system and UI toolkits as much as possible.
DUIM's API is intended to insulate the programmer from most of the complexities
of portability, since the DUIM application need only deal with DUIM objects and
functions regardless of their operating platform (that is, the combination of
Dylan, the host computer, and the host window environment).  DUIM abstracts out
many of the concepts common to all window environments.  The programmer is
encouraged to think in terms of these abstractions, rather than in the specific
capabilities of a particular host system.  For example, using DUIM, the
programmer can specify the appearance of output in high-level terms and those
high-level descriptions are turned into the appropriate appearance for the given
host.  Thus, the application has the same fundamental interface across multiple
environments, although the details will differ from system to system.

DUIM's layered design allows application programs to exclude facilities that
they do not use, or reimplement or extend any part of the substrate.  To these
ends, DUIM is specified and implemented in a layered, modular fashion based on
protocols.  Each facility documented in this specification has several layers of
interface, and each facility is independently specified and has a documented
external interface.


TERMINOLOGY

A _sheet_ is the basic unit of "windowing".  All sheets have the following
attributes:
  - 'sheet-region', expressed in the sheet's own coordinate system
  - 'sheet-transform', which maps the sheets coordinate system to the coordinate
    system of its parent
  - 'sheet-parent', which is #f if the sheet has no parent
  - 'sheet-mapped?' flag, which tells if the sheet is visible on a display
    (ignoring issues of occluding windows)

The sheet's transform is an instance of a concrete subclass of <transform>.  The
sheet's region can be an instance of any concrete subclass of <region>, but is
usually represented by the particularly efficient region class <bounding-box>.

Some sheets can also have single or multiple children, in which case they have:
  - a 'sheet-children' slot
  - methods to add, remove, and replace a child
  - methods to map over children

The functions that maintain the sheet's region and transform are part of the
_sheet geometry_ protocol.  Functions that maintain a sheet's parent and
children are part of the _sheet genealogy_ protocol.  Note that the sheet
geometry and genealogy protocols are independent.  Adding a child to a sheet
that is larger than its parent does _not_ cause the parent's region to grow.
Shrinking the region of a parent does not cause the children to shrink.  You
must maintain the region yourself, either by explicitly setting the sheet's
region and transform, or by using the layout facilities ('compose-space' and
'allocate-space').

As a convenience, there are some "glue" functions that mediate between geometry
and layout: 'set-sheet-position', 'set-sheet-size', and 'set-sheet-edges'.

_Input sheets_ are sheets that can do input, in which case they have:
  - a 'sheet-event-queue' slot
  - methods for 'handle-event'

An _event_ is an object representing some sort of event.  The most important
events are subclasses of <device-event> (for example, <button-press-event> and
<key-press-event>).

Some sheets can be repainted, in which case they have:
  - methods for 'handle-repaint'

_Output sheets_ can do output, in which case they have:
  - a 'sheet-medium' slot

A _medium_ is an object that wraps up both a drawing surface and some drawing
state, including:
  - default foreground and background
  - a _brush_, which controls how graphical objects are filled and colored
  - a _pen_, which controls how paths are stroked
  - a _text style_, which controls what font to use for text
  - a _clipping region_
  - a user transform
  - a set of 'draw-xxx' methods

Two graphics models are supports: _figure-based graphics_ and _path-based_
graphics.  The figure-based graphics functionality includes such functions as
'draw-line' and 'draw-ellipse'.	 The path-based graphics functionality includes
such functions as 'move-to', 'curve-to', 'fill-path', and 'stroke-path'.

Output sheets also support _pixmap_ operations, such as 'copy-area'.  Pixmaps
are a special case of a more general class of _images_.	 In general, images are
a way to describe a representation of a set of colors in a drawing plane.
_Patterns_ are a portable kind of image, but there are also specific kinds of
images such as <tiff-image>, <xbm-image>, and so forth.

A sheet can be attached to a _display_, which is an object that represents a
single display (or screen) on some display server.

A display (and all the sheets attached to the display) is associated with a
_port_, which is a connection to a display server.  The port manages
  - a primary input device, such as a keyboard
  - a pointing device, such as a mouse
  - an event processor, which _dispatches_ events to the appropriate sheet

Some sheets participate in layouts, in which case we often refer to them as
_panes_.  The layout protocol is two-pass; the first pass is the _space
composition_ pass (which builds up a set of _space requirement_ objects
describing the desired, minimum, and maximum size for each pane), and the second
pass is the _space allocation_ pass (which allocates real estate to each pane
after solving the constraints that represent the desired size for each pane).
(The layout protocol, in effect, serves as glue between the genealigy and
geometry protocols.)

Some sheets act as "controls", in which case we refer to them as _gadgets_.
Examples include push buttons, scroll bars, and sliders.

A _frame_ is an object representing some state in a user application, plus the
panes in its interface.	 A frame might include such things as a menu bar, a tool
bar, and a status bar.

A frame has a top level loop that processes events received by the frame.  One
important kind of event is a <command-event>, which is received in response to
_commands_.  A command is an object representing an interaction with the user.
Commands can be arranged in _command tables_, which drive the creation of menu
bars.  Command tables allow semantic components of applications to be shared
among different frames.

The look and feel of a frame and its panes are created via a _frame manager_.
The frame manager maps an _abstract pane_ (such as <slider>) to a _concrete
pane_ (such as <motif-slider>).	 The frame manager is also responsible for
generating the appropriate UI for menus, dialogs, directory choosers, and so
forth.

The process of creating a native window-system object from an abstract pane is
called _mirroring_; the abstract pane is referred to as a _mirrored sheet_ and
the native window-system object is referred to as a _mirror_.  Mapping a
mirrored sheet causes the mirror itself to be mapped.

- Bounding Boxes
  - A bounding box is a derived property of every bounded region. A region's
    bounding box is the smallest rectangle (whose sides are parallel to the
    coordinate axes) that contains all the points of a region.
  - The position of a box is its upper-left corner.
  - The representation of a bounding box is chosen to be very efficient.
  - At the user-level API, bounding boxes are immutable but "volatile".	 That
    is, a user cannot change the edges of a bounding box, but DUIM itself might.

- Simple Regions
  - A region is an object that denotes a set of mathematical points in the
    plane.  Regions include their boundaries, that is, they are closed.
  - A bounded region is a region that contains at least one point and for which
    there exists a number, D, called the region's diameter, such that if P1 and
    P2 are points in the region, the distance between P1 and P2 is always less
    than or equal to D.
  - The basic region classes in DUIM include only points, bounding boxes, and
    bounding box sets.
  - All regions can be transformed by the DUIM transform operators.
  - The graphics and windowing modules use the same set of geometric objects and
    functions.
  - The coordinate system in which the geometric objects reside is an abstract,
    continuous coordinate system.  This abstract coordinate system is converted
    into "real world" coordinates only during operations such as drawing one
    of the objects on a display device.

- Transformations
  - An affine transform is a mapping from one coordinate system onto another
    that preserves straight lines.  General affine transforms include all the
    sorts of transforms that DUIM uses, namely, translations, scaling,
    rotations, and reflections.

- Colors
  - An "ink" is an object that represents a way of arranging colors and
    opacities in the drawing plane.  Intuitively, it is anything that can be
    drawn with.  Colors, images, and patterns are all subclasses of <ink>.
  - A color is an ink that represents the intuitive definition of color: white,
    black, red, pale yellow, and so forth.  The visual appearance of a single
    point is completely described by its color.
  - A color can be specified by four real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive),
    giving the amounts of red, green, blue, and opacity ("alpha").  Three 0's
    for the RGB components mean black; three 1's mean white.  An opacity value
    of 0 is fully transparent; a value of 1 is fully opaque.

- Text Styles
  - A text style is an "abstract font".
  - Four components: family, weight, slant, size.
  - Text styles need not be fully specified.  If any component is #f, it gets
    filled in against a default.
  - Text styles are abstract, and get mapped into platform-specific fonts when a
    text drawing function is called.
