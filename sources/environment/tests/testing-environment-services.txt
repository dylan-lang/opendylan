TESTING ENVIRONMENT SERVICES

* Introduction

This document describes how to manually test the services provided by
"DylanWorks" to external programs, e.g., editors.  Since use of these
services in general requires inter-process communication and user
interaction, it is difficult to test automatically.

** Scope

This document covers the following services and clients.

Services:

  - Describe
  - Find Definitions
  - Browse
  - Compile (parse, compile changes, compile all, link only, build)
  - Complete [NYI]
  - Find Uses [NYI]
  - Documentation [NYI]

[NYI = Not yet implemented]

Clients:

  - Deuce
  - Emacs [NYI]

Deuce is not, strictly speaking, an external program, but it uses the
same channels to access the services.

** Usage

This document is intended as a manual test-suite for the services
provided by the environment.  Testers should follow the descriptions
for the combinations of client and service they wish to test.

All responses, correct or incorrect, should be recorded.  Any errors
or problems not anticipated in this document should be reported,
including (but not limited to): error dialogs other than those
anticipated; crashes; lack of successful response from a service, when
it should succeed; or unavailability of any given means to invoke a
service (e.g., some menu item is missing).


* Test Descriptions

** Lookup services

The services Describe, Find Definitions, Browse, Complete and Find
Uses require that string, to which they are applied, appear as the
name (or, for Complete, an initial substring of a name) of a Dylan
definition in a project, which is loaded into the environment.  Such a
string will be referred to as "valid" here.  Invalid strings include
(but may not be limited to) strings which do not appear in any open
project, strings which are not valid Dylan names (since they cannot be
names of definitions) and strings used as names of things other than
definitions (module names in headers, local variables, symbols etc.).

The project must also have been at least "parsed" for these services
to produce the desired information, but if it has not been, the
environment should remain stable.

The term "function" here includes definitions of generic functions,
methods on generic functions, bare methods (from "define function")
and also definitions of sealed domains, since these have the same name
as some generic function.

To test each lookup service, select a string and invoke the service.
Try the following kinds of string:

  - Before any project has been loaded ...
    - a Dylan definition name appearing in some existing project. [*]
    - a non-name string; [*]
  - With a project loaded but not parsed ...
    - a Dylan definition name appearing in some loaded project. [*]
    - a non-name string; [*]
    - a name of a local variable; [*]
  - With a project loaded and parsed ...
    - an invalid string; [*]
    - a name of a local variable; [*]
    - the name of some defined instance of each of the following:
      - a class;
      - a function (only finds generic functions and bare methods);
      - a variable;
      - a constant;
      - a macro.

For cases marked [*], the environment should display an error message
informing you that the string could not be found (or that no project
or module could be found relevant to the context where the service was
invoked).  In no cases should the environment crash, or provide any
other sort of error message.

*** Describe

This service provides a summary of the definition of a name in a
project.

For valid strings, the string and the kind of definition it refers to
are displayed.  The module, library and source record where the
definition appears may also be given, depending on environment
options.  Further information displayed depends on the kind of
definition:

  Definition  Information
  ----------  -----------
  class       superclasses list
  function    parameter list and return values list
  variable    type
  constant    type
  macro       none

*** Find Definitions

This service finds all definitions with a given name, in a given
module and project context.

For names of objects which have at least one explicit definition in
the given context, the environment's editor will display that
definition.  For those which have more than one definition, these will
be displayed in some kind of "chooser" window, from which you should
be able easily to edit any one.

Objects may have no explicit definition, e.g., implicit generic
functions, or they may have several, if searching is done across
modules or projects, or includes module and library names as well as
binding names.  Objects may have several definitions either because
that is normal for Dylan (i.e., for methods) or again because
searching is done across contexts.

[As of 1997/06/09, searching is _not_ done across contexts, nor are
modules and libraries included in searching.]

*** Browse

This service causes the environment to browse the object to which a
valid name is bound, exactly as if it had had the environment's
standard "Browse" operation applied to it.  It may or may not open a
new browser window to do so.

If the same name appears in more than one open project, the
environment should open a "chooser" window from which a name can be
selected and browsed -- check that it does.

** Compilation service

The interface to compilation is sufficiently simple that it is
provided by one service, Compile, with a parameter governing which
state or stages of compilation processing to perform: parse, compile
changes, compile all, link only, build.  [Parse may be omitted in
future versions of the environment.]

Each of these stages is identical to the action of the same (or
similar) name on a project window's "Build" menu.  Invoking one of
these actions should apply the normal compilation process(*) to the
"relevant" open project.  For invocation from editors, this means
whichever project contains the source file displayed in the window
from which the service was invoked.

(* This process will occur either in a project window or in a separate
compilation window, depending on what we've decided to implement.)

---*** Issue: In the unlikely but possible circumstance that the
source file occurs in more than one open project, it seems to be
currently undefined, what the environment will do.  Please check this.


* Clients

** Deuce

The lookup services are all invoked by selecting a region of text and
then using the context (right mouse button) menu to select the
service.  If no selection exists, right-clicking over text will select
"the nearest string which looks like a Dylan name".

[---*** Issue: these services should probably also be available from
an "Object" menu on the menu bar.]

The compile services are available on the "Build" menu, just as in the
environment's project windows.  They should also be available from the
context menu, when the right mouse button is clicked outside any
selection and not over any text (i.e., off the right-hand side of the
text).
