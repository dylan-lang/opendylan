// Once boxing has been completed we introduce additional temporaries in the
// consequent branch of conditionals to improve typing precision.
// We do this when the conditional has one of the following forms:
//
//    if (x) ...                         if (instance?(x, y)) ...
//
// In the first case we introduce a new temporary for the duration of the
// consequent branch whose type is the inferred type for x with any #f
// component removed.
// In the second case the temporary's type is the intersection of the type
// of x and y.  We only do this transformation for unboxed variables.
//
// The temporaries are introduced via a new kind of temporary-transfer
// computation called <constrain-type>.  The type component of this
// computation has two roles corresponding to the two scenarios outlined above
// (i.e. it is either #f or contains a type).
// Due to limitations of the type system (e.g. no intersection types) the type
// pruning is only an approximation.  However, this should always be safe as
// the worst that will happen is that the new temporary will have the same type
// as the original variable.
