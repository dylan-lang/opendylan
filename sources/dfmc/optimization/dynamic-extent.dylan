/// Dynamic extent analysis:
//
//   This file contains a fairly simple-minded dynamic-extent analysis.
// For each lambda we compute the dynamic extent of each parameter. As
// part of the analysis we optimise #rest parameters that have dynamic
// extent by removing the redundant copy-vector.  We also tag any
// closures that we detect have dynamic extent.  The analysis is fairly
// simple-minded in at least a couple of ways:
//
// 1) In the case of recursive lambdas we don't attempt to solve the
// dataflow equations via iteration, but break the loop in a conservative
// fashion.  For #rest parameter and closure analysis this doesn't appear
// too restrictive, but if other optimizations started using the dynamic
// extent information then we may find the analysis is too conservative.
//
// 2) A parameter is treated as having dynamic extent only if it cannot
// escape from the method.  So if a method M, with parameter X, passes X
// to the identity function, and then discards the result, the parameter
// will not be viewed as having dynamic extent.  A more refined analysis
// would keep track of the dependencies between parameters and results.
// However, initial results suggest that things like the forward
// iteration protocol (see below) currently account for much more of the
// precision loss than a more refined analysis.
//
// The main problems that arise with this simple extent analysis are due
// to generic functions, particularly open ones.  We run the analysis
// late in the optimization phase, so any calls to known methods have
// already been resolved.  If we have a call to a generic function, and
// we know all the applicable methods, then we take the intersection of
// all their extents in the obvious way.  Suppose method M1 has dynamic
// extent on parameters 0 and 1, and M2 has dynamic extent on parameters
// 0 and 2.  If they are both part of the generic function M, and a call
// to M can be statically resolved to one of M1 or M2, then we would
// deduce that the call would allow the first argument to have dynamic
// extent, but not the others.
//
// The problem is more serious when open generics are involved.  In the
// worst case this means we must assume that no arguments can have
// dynamic extent if we call a generic where all applicable methods are
// not known.  This means that even simple expressions like "X = Y" would
// prevent X and Y from having dynamic extent if the types of X and Y
// were not very constrained.  One approach that can help here is to
// associate some dynamic extent information with the generic and then
// ensure that all methods added to the generic satisfy these
// constraints.  So we might declare that both arguments to any method on
// \= must have dynamic extent. Obviously this would conflict with the
// DRM, although one could make the case that certain methods should be
// documented as being functional.  We would also need to ensure that any
// methods added via add-method satisfied the constraints.  The problem
// here is perhaps similar to that of enforcing the make method guarantee
// when methods can be added dynamically.  At the moment the only
// constraint on a generic function that we can express is that all
// parameters must have dynamic extent, via the dynamic-extent modifier.
// The code will then check that any methods added at compile-time adhere
// to this constraint.  Thus one could allow generic functions like
// equality to interact "correctly" with extent analysis, with a slight
// modification to the DRM, but we have not added the appropriate
// modifiers to the Dylan library at this time.
//
// The nastiest problem is due to the current definition of the forward
// iteration protocol.  If it was required to be functional then
// everything would be fine.  We could not deduce that a collection
// passed to the fip had dynamic extent, as the collection could be
// passed out as part of the result.  However, with a slight alteration
// to the for macro, using something like
//
//   let dy = collection; %dynamic-extent(dy); let (...) = fip(dy);
//
// we could ensure that any use of a collection in a for loop did not
// prevent it from having dynamic-extent.  This is because we can ensure
// that in this case the results of the call to the fip cannot escape the
// for loop.  Unfortunately, the DRM places no such constraint on the
// fip, although it is almost inconceivable that someone would write a
// method on the fip that wasn't functional.  The net effect is that any
// use of a collection in a for loop prevents it from having dynamic
// extent unless we have a fairly precise type for the collection which
// allows the call to the fip to be expanded out.  As many of the
// higher-order functions such as map and do depend on the fip, any use
// of these methods will also prevent a collection from having dynamic
// extent.  These methods are not currently inlined, and so this causes a
// problem even if we have an accurate type for the collection.  At the
// moment this problem seems to be the biggest cause of parameters not
// being flagged as having dynamic extent when they should have.


// We associate a <dynamic-extent> with each lambda, method and GF.
// It contains a list of those arguments that can safely have dynamic
// extent when passed to the function.  We use #t as an abbreviation
// to indicate that they all can.  The value #f is used to indicate that
// the extent has not been computed yet.
