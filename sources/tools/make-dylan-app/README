make-dylan-app is a tool to create new Dylan projects.

Usage:
	make-dylan-app project-name

This will automatically generate a folder (named after the project name you
supplied) which contains 3 files:

     project-name.dylan
     library.dylan
     project-name.lid.

All these files contain reasonable default content and you can compile your
project with

	dylan-compiler -build project-name.lid
