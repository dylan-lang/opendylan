Docuemnt: Dylan Test Suite Guide

Author: Shri Amit(amit)

Synopsis: The following document explains the
          Dylan Test Suite - its design and
	  execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: It is suggested that changes made to this suite be 
      noted and explained in this document which is intended 
      to accompany the suite. Such a document can be of much
      value to the maintainer of this code

Revision History:
         o August 24 1996 by amit. First submission after
          conversion to new Testworks protocol.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Historical Note:
	This test suite was initially designed and coded by
programmers at Apple Computers Inc. After the code was
acquired by Harlequin, James Kirsch who designed and wrote
the new version of Testworks started to convert these to be
compatible with the new Testworks. The task was soon taken
over by Shri Amit and was completed on August 24 1996.

How to use these Suites:
-----------------------
	Any of these suites can be run from a dylan prompt,
after loading, by the following command:
	dylan> perform-suite(test-SUITENAME-suite);

where, SUITNAME is the name of the suite. An example:
	dylan> perform-suite(test-array-suite);

shall execute the array-suite. The output can be seen on
the screen from where the lispworks image was invoked (that
is assuming you are running a lispworks emulator image). Each
of the tests can also be individually run by the command:
	dylan> perform-test(testname);

For more details on how to use and modify these suites, consult
testworks documentation.

Other Useful Documentation to consult:
-------------------------------------
	o Testworks Users Documentation - James Kirsch
	    This is sufficient if someone desires to use
	    and modify these test suites only.
	    (Can be found in Notes or D-lib-testworks)

	o Testworks Programmers Documentation - James Kirsch
	    If you need more implementation information on
	    Testworks, this is the place to look for.

Issues:
-------
	The following is a list of outstanding issues relating to
the Dylan Test Suite being complied in the lispworks emulator. When
each of these are resolved or any development is made in this regard,
please document it here. 

 o The following checks/tests are potential bugs
     + instance? problems:
	. aref-setter does not return #t for <generic-function>
	. Limited integers do not test true to their limitations
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test LIMITED-INTEGERS
	       . Test LIMITED-COLLECTIONS
	       . Test UNION-ON-TYPES
	       . Test UNION-ON-LIMITED-TYPES
	. singleton(99) does not return #t for <singleton>:
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test INSTANCE?-2
	       . Test SINGLETON-0
	. <table> does not test true for any of its superclasses
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test INSTANCE?-3
	. <array> does not test true for any of its superclasses
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test INSTANCE?-4
	. <byte-string> does not test true for its superclasses
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test INSTANCE?-10
	. <complex> does not test true for <number>
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test INSTANCE?-16
	. object-class does not test true for <function>
	   . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	       . Test OBJECT-CLASS-TYPE
	. method tests as an instance of <generic-function> whereas
	  it should not as its superclass is <function> only
	. final-state is some function unlisted in DRM which tests
	  true for function but not for generic-function. According
	  to the original test it should?? A whole bunch of tests
	  fail due to the same. I am curious if this is defunct or what?
 
     + Suite TEST-COLLECTION-SUITE Test MAP-AS-8 failed. 
	. Check (#1) failed [#t != #f]
	    Seems like a straightforward function and so looks like
	    a bug to me. In test-collection.dylan

     + Suite TEST-COLLECTION-SUITE Test FIND-KEY-0 failed. 
        . Check (#1) failed [4 != #t]
	    Seems like a straightforward function and so looks like
	    a bug to me. In test-collection.dylan

     + make (<complex>) causes some kind of Size is not in legal range error
	. Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	   . Test CLASS-FOR-COPY-0
	   . Test INSTANCE?-16
	   . Test INSTANCE?-23 (commented out cuz wont compile)
	. Suite TEST-COLLECTION-SUITE
	   . Test =-<COMPLEX>
	   . Test p=complex
	   . Test =hash-complex
	. Suite TEST-NUMBER-SUITE
	   . Test zero-0? check #8, #9

     + The = operation sets values out of limitation scope
	. Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	   . Test TYPE-SURVIVE-ASSIGNMENT-2

     + slot superclasses: of <class>:
	 . Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	    . Test MAKE-<CLASS>-INDIRECT : this slot keeps looking
              for type <list> as its argument whereas DRM says that
              it should look for <object> or <sequence>

     + type-union returns <object> whereas DRM says that it should 
          return <type>

     + Suite TEST-COMPARISON-SUITE, The very second check is the
	  wierdest thing I have seen to signal a bus error

     + Suite TEST-CONTROL-SUITE has 3 tests: cond-3, and-2 and or-3
	which are failing and they look like bugs to me.

     + Suite TEST-DEFINES-SUITE has 2 interesting problems:
	. a variable test-variable is unrecognized even though
	  it is defined in test-preamble which is in the lib-file
	  refer test defines
	. test define-like-bind-1a does not error even when it sets
	  a declared integer variable to a string expression

     + Reverse seems to have a problem in Suite test-function-suite
	check #1, it refuses a sequence with no applicable method

     + A couple of \+ operations in Suite test-intro-mop not only
       fail but also return an instance of <ratio> which is really
       bizzare cuz ratio is not defined. Do run this suite for
       sure as there are a bunch of interlocked problems including
       the problem with values - I have put comments to show where
       the problems are.

     + In Suite TEST-NUMBER-SUITE a whole bunch of functions should
	be accepting <object>'s but refuse to take anything but
	<number>'s , they are:  Test +-0,  Test *-0, Test Q--1

 o The following checks/tests are due to some unimplemented function
     + class <ratio>: (commented out as they hampered compilation)
	. Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	   . Test INSTANCE?-18
	   . Test INSTANCE?-23
	. Suite TEST-COMPARISON-SUITE
	   . =-0, qw, p=hash, q, w>
	. Suite TEST-NUMBER-SUITE - a whole bunch of stuff commented
	  out because of the fact
     + pairs:
	. Suite TEST-COLLECTION-SUITE
	   . a=-1, p=-1, =hash-1
	. Suite TEST-LIST-SUITE
	   . commented out pair-0 because it wont compile
     + Creation of unicode strings is not supported in the emulator.
	. Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE
	   . Test AS-SEQUENCE-PERMUTATIONS, check #1
	   . Test CLASS-FOR-COPY-1, check #1
	   . Test CLASS-FOR-COPY-2
	   . Test CLASS-FOR-COPY-3
	   . Test INSTANCE?-4
	   . Test INSTANCE?-9
	. Suite TEST-ITERATION-SUITE
	   . Test  INITIAL-STATE-EMPTY-COLLECTIONS , check #1

     + seal : could not find any generic-function of this name,
       again there were tests in Suite TEST-CLASS-SUITE for this???

     + Suite TEST-COLLECTION-SUITE failed. Test MAP-11 failed. Check 1 
	It does not have an applicable method for this case..weird!
	
     + Suite TEST-COMPARISON-SUITE has a variety of things that are unbound:
	&, &=, binary= and =hash. Run the suite for more details.
	   . Suite Test-control-suite has the same problem with Test not-type-0
	   . Suite Test-range-suite does not recognize binary=

     + <abort> and abort() are undefined - Suite TEST-CONDITION check abort-0

     + type-error-slots is undefined, Suite TEST-CONDITION Check type-error-slots

     + Suite test-control-suite has a for-each() test which does not compile

     + add-method seems to be unimplemented:
	. Suite TEST-FUNCTION-SUITE
	   . Test AMBIGUOUS-METHOD-1, 2
	. Suite TEST-INTRO-MOP SUITE
	   . Test GENERIC-FCN-VALUES-2A

     + remove-method also is the same:
	. Suite TEST-FUNCTION-SUITE
	   . Test REMOVE-METHOD-TYPE 

     + other ones in test-function suite were withdraw and applicable-method?

     + In test-number-suite.dylan has a plethora of functions that are
	unimplemented: binary, unary, log, trig stuff etc etc.

 o Unclassified glitches:
	+ Unable to compile test-sequence-lib.dylan. The error is:
	Error: Tried to call non-function {instance of <test>} (bound to 
        DYLAN+DYLAN/INTERNAL::INTERSECTION) with arguments (NIL NIL 
        :TEST #<Function DYLAN-EQ>)
	As a result of this I have been unable to execute and test the
	suite. It is really huge and would be very painful to try to do the
	tests individually. Although, all the other files compile individually.
        
	+ In test-class2.dylan , test make-<class> signals a bus error
	when executed. It compiles but just does not execute - dunno why?

	+ Any number say 4 for instance(in test-class2.dylan) does not
	test #t as a <complex>, but isnt it just a complex number with
	a zero imaginary part or was this a design decision to keep it
	this way??
	
	+ Suite TEST-COLLECTION-SUITE, Tests any-9? and any-10? in
	test-collection2.dylan just does not compile and I cant
	figure out why? - err..hate when that happens!

	+ If something is say an Open Generic Function then should it
	also test true as an instance of <function>. If not then check
	out test-comparison.dylan =-type test
	
	+ Some signals and stuff in test-condition suite have been failing with
	wrong condition for eg: Test CERROR-2 failed.
    	(#1) Check  raised the wrong condition failed [#<SIMPLE-ERROR 100AFE9C> 
	!= {the class SIMPLE-ERROR}] I did not think this was very critical. Or
	maybe it is?

	+ The whole handler chunk in test-condition suite simply fails to
	compile with a bus error. I dont understand what is wrong.
