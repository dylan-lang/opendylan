The Dylan Project Notebook
##########################

Welcome to the Dylan Project Notebook. This is meant to supplement, not
replace, other means of communication about the Dylan project.

What is the Dylan Project Notebook?

* A place to write about projects happening within the Open Dylan
  code and sometimes other Dylan libraries.
* A place to look for something interesting to work on.
* A place to write about possible choices within a project, the current
  status of a project, what remains to be done.
* A place for blue-sky ideas about future projects, but within reason.
* A place where a `Dylan Enhancement Proposal`_ might be born.

This is not:

* A replacement for the bug tracker. If there's a bug and it is something
  that we intend to fix, then it should be in the `GitHub issue tracker`_.
* A replacement for the `Hacker's Guide`_. While the Hacker's Guide does
  need a lot of work and additional content, it is meant to describe what
  is currently present and how to go about working with the Open Dylan
  internals.
* A replacement for writing and publishing a `Dylan Enhancement Proposal`_.

There are some other things that we need to sort out and include into
this document as well:

* Cross-compilation considerations.
* Improving the numeric tower.
* Bring back ``<ratio>``?
* Have a wider variety of fixed size numeric types for integrating
  with C-FFI?
