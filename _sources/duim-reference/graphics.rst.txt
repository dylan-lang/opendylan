Overview
========

The DUIM-Graphics library contains interfaces that define a wide variety
drawing operations for use in your GUI applications, as well as two
classes. The library contains a single module, *duim-graphics*, from
which all the interfaces described in this chapter are exposed.
`DUIM-Graphics Module`_ contains complete reference
entries for each exposed interface.

The DUIM graphic drawing model is an idealized model of graphical
pictures. The model provides the language that application programs use
to describe the intended visual appearance of textual and graphical
output. Usually not all of the contents of the screen are described
using the graphic drawing model. For example, menus and scroll bars
would usually be described in higher-level terms.

An important aspect of the DUIM graphic drawing model is its extreme
device independence. The model describes ideal graphical images and
ignores limitations of actual graphics devices. One consequence of this
is that the actual visual appearance of the screen can only be an
approximation of the appearance specified by the model: however, another
important consequence of this is that the model is highly portable.

DUIM separates output into two layers:

A text/graphics layer in which you specify the desired visual appearance
independent of device resolution and characteristics

#. A rendering layer in which some approximation of the desired visual
   appearance is created on the device.

Of course application programs can inquire about the device resolution
and characteristics if they wish and modify their desired visual
appearance on that basis. There is also a third layer above these two
layers, the adaptive toolkit layer where one specifies the desired
functionality rather than the desired visual appearance.

Definitions
===========

This section contains definitions of terms that will be used in this
chapter.

- *Drawing plane* A drawing plane is an infinite two-dimensional plane
  on which graphical output occurs. The drawing plane contains an
  arrangement of colors and opacities that is modified by each
  graphical output operation. It is not possible to read back the
  contents of a drawing plane, except by examining the output-history.
  Normally each window has its own drawing plane.
- *Coordinates* Coordinates are a pair of real numbers in
  implementation-defined units that identify a point in the drawing
  plane.
- *Mediums* In this chapter, we use a medium as a destination for
  output. The medium has a drawing plane, two designs (called the
  medium's foreground and background), a transformation, a clipping
  region, a line style, and a text style. There are per-medium,
  dynamically scoped, default drawing options. Different medium classes
  are provided to allow you to draw on different sorts of devices, such
  as displays, printers, and virtual devices such as bitmaps.
- *Sheets* Many sheets can be used for doing output, so the drawing
  functions can also take a sheet as the output argument. In this case,
  drawing function "trampolines" to the sheet's medium. So, while the
  functions defined here are specified to be called on mediums, they
  can also be called on sheets.
- *Streams* A stream is a special kind of sheet that implements the
  stream protocol; streams include additional state such as the current
  text cursor (which is some point in the drawing plane).
- By default, the "fundamental" coordinate system of a DUIM stream (not
  a general sheet or medium, whose fundamental coordinate system is not
  defined) is a left handed system with x increasing to the right, and
  y increasing downward. (0,0) is at the upper left corner.
- For more general information about DUIM streams, you should refer to
  the manual *Library Reference: System and I/O*.

Drawing is approximate
======================

Note that although the drawing plane contains an infinite number of
mathematical points, and drawing can be described as an infinite number
of color and opacity computations, the drawing plane cannot be viewed
directly and has no material existence: it is only an abstraction. What
*can* be viewed directly is the result of rendering portions of the
drawing plane onto a medium. No infinite computations or objects of
infinite size are required to implement DUIM, because the results of
rendering have finite size and finite resolution.

A drawing plane is described as having infinitely fine spatial, color,
and opacity resolution, and as allowing coordinates of unbounded
positive or negative magnitude. A viewport into a drawing plane, on the
other hand, views only a finite region (usually rectangular) of the
drawing plane. Furthermore, a viewport has limited spatial resolution
and can only produce a limited number of colors. These limitations are
imposed by the display hardware on which the viewport is displayed. A
viewport also has limited opacity resolution, determined by the finite
arithmetic used in the drawing engine.

Coordinates are real numbers in implementation-defined units. Often
these units equal the spatial resolution of a viewport, so that a line
of thickness 1 is equivalent to the thinnest visible line. However, this
equivalence is not required and should not be assumed by application
programs.

DUIM can be quite restrictive in the size and resolution of its
viewports. For example, the spatial resolution might be only a few dozen
points per inch, the maximum size might be only a few hundred points on
a side, and there could be as few as two displayable colors (usually
black and white). Fully transparent and fully opaque opacity levels are
supported, but a DUIM implementation might support only a few opacity
levels in between (or possibly even none). A DUIM implementation might
implement color blending and unsaturated colors by stippling, although
it is preferred, when possible, for a viewport to display a uniform
color as a uniform color rather than as a perceptible stipple.

However, there are no such limitations when DUIM records the output to a
sheet, since DUIM just remembers the drawing operations that were
performed, not the results of rendering.

The application programmer uses the DUIM graphic drawing model as an
interface to describe the intended visual appearance. DUIM then
approximates that ideal appearance in a viewport, within its limitations
of spatial resolution, color resolution, number of simultaneously
displayable colors, and drawing speed.

Naturally, doing this usually requires trade-offs, for example between
speed and accuracy, and these trade-offs depend on the hardware and
software environment and the user concerns in any given situation. For
example:

- If the device only supports a limited number of colors, the desired
  color may be approximated using techniques such as dithering or
  stippling.
- If the device cannot draw curves precisely, they may be approximated,
  with or without anti-aliasing.
- If the device has limited opacity resolution, color blending may be
  approximate. A viewport might display colors that do not appear in
  the drawing plane, both because of color and opacity approximation
  and because of anti-aliasing at the edges of drawn shapes.

Drawing computations are always carried out "in color", even if the
viewport is only capable of displaying black and white. In other words,
the DUIM drawing model is always the fully general model, even if an
implementation's color resolution is limited enough that full use of the
model is not possible. Of course an application that fundamentally
depends on color will not work well on a viewport that cannot display
color. Other applications will degrade gracefully.

Whether the implementation uses raster graphics or some other display
technique is invisible at this interface. DUIM does not specify the
existence of pixels nor the exact details of scan conversion, which will
vary from one drawing engine to the next.

Rendering conventions for geometric shapes
==========================================

This section describes the conventions for how DUIM renders a shape on a
display device.

When DUIM draws a geometric shape on a display device, the idealized
geometric shape must somehow be rendered on that device. This involves
mapping points on the idealized geometric shape onto points on the
display device.

Idealized geometric shapes are made up of a set of mathematical points
which have no size. The rendering of these shapes on the display device
is usually composed of pixels, which are roughly square, and are
specified in "device coordinates". Device coordinates are calculated by
transforming the user-supplied coordinates by each of the following:

- The user-supplied transformation
- The medium transformation
- The transformation that maps from the sheet to the display device

.. note:: If the last of these is a pure translation that translates by an
   integer multiple of device units, then it has no effect on the rendering
   other than placement of the figure drawn on the display device.

Roughly speaking, a pixel is affected by drawing a shape only when it is
inside that shape. Since pixels are little squares, and the abstract
points in an idealized geometric shape have no size, most shapes will
have many pixels that lie only partially inside the shape. It is
important, therefore, to describe which pixels will be affected when
rendering a shape, and which will not.

On devices that support color or grayscale, the rendering engine uses
anti-aliasing techniques to render pixels that lie only partially inside
the shape. That is, the affected pixels are drawn a little lighter than
pixels that are wholly within the shape, the precise shade depending on
how much of it is inside the shape.

The conventions used by DUIM are the same as the conventions used by
X11:

- A pixel is a addressed by its upper-left corner.
- A pixel is considered to be inside a shape, and hence affected by the
  rendering of that shape, if the center of the pixel is inside the
  shape. If the center of the pixel lies exactly on the boundary of the
  shape, it is considered to be inside the shape if the inside of the
  shape is immediately to the right of the center point of the pixel
  (that is, an increasing x direction on the display device). If the
  center of the pixel lies exactly on a horizontal boundary, it is
  considered to be inside the shape if the inside of the shape is
  immediately below the center point of the pixel (that is, an
  increasing y direction on the display device). This situation is
  illustrated in :ref:`how-pixels-are-defined-inside-outside`.
- An unfilled idealized geometric shape is drawn by calculating an
  artificial area for the shape, and then deciding which pixels are
  inside or outside that area, using the rules described above. The
  artificial area is calculated by taking the filled shape consisting
  of those points that are within half the line thickness from the
  outline curve (using a normal distance function, that is, the length
  of the line drawn at right angles to the tangent to the outline curve
  at the nearest point). To visualize this, imagine a filled shape the
  same size as the unfilled shape, and overlay on this filled shape an
  identical, but slightly smaller, unfilled shape.

.. _how-pixels-are-defined-inside-outside:

.. figure:: images/graphics-3.png
   :align: center

   How pixels are defined to be "inside" and "outside" shapes

It is important to note that these rules imply that the decision point
used for insideness checking is offset from the point used for
addressing the pixel by half a device unit in both the x and y
directions. It is worth considering the motivations for these
conventions.

When two shapes share a common edge, it is important that only one of the
shapes own any pixel. The two triangles in :ref:`two-triangles` illustrate
this. The pixels along the diagonal belong to the lower figure. When the
decision point of the pixel (its center) lies to one side of the line or the
other, there is no issue. When the boundary passes through a decision point,
which side the inside of the figure is on is used to decide.


.. _two-triangles:

.. figure:: images/graphics-4.png
   :align: center

   Two triangles

The reason for choosing the decision point half a pixel offset from the
address point is to reduce the number of common figures (such as
rectilinear lines and rectangles with integral coordinates) that invoke
the boundary condition rule. This usually leads to more symmetrical
results. For instance, shows a circle drawn when the decision point is
the same as the address point. The four lighter points are
indeterminate: it is not clear whether they are inside or outside the
shape. Since each boundary case is determined according to which side
has the figure on it, and since the same rule must be applied uniformly
for all figures, there is no choice but to pick only two of the four
points, leading to an undesirable lopsided figure.

.. figure:: images/graphics-5.png
   :align: center

   Choosing any two of the shaded pixels causes asymmetry

If all four boundary points had been chosen instead, the result would be
a symmetrical figure. However, since this figure is symmetrical about a whole
pixel, it is one pixel wider than it ought to be. The problem with this can be
seen clearly in :ref:`two-forms-of-circle-inscribed-in-a-square`, in which
a circle is drawn over a square.  In the left-hand figure, the decision point
is at the center of the pixel, but in the right-hand figure, it is not.

.. _two-forms-of-circle-inscribed-in-a-square:

.. figure:: images/graphics-6.png
   :align: center

   Two forms of a circle inscribed in a square

It is for this reason that the decision point is at the center of the
pixel. This draws circles that look like the one in
:ref:`an-aesthetically-pleasing-circle`

.. _an-aesthetically-pleasing-circle:

.. figure:: images/graphics-7.png
   :align: center

   An aesthetically pleasing circle

A consequence of these rendering conventions is that, when the start or
end coordinate (minus half the line thickness, if the shape is a path)
is not an integer, then rendering is not symmetric under reflection
transformations. Thus, to correctly and portably draw an outline of
thickness 1 around a (rectilinear) rectangular area with integral
coordinates, the outline path must have half-integral coordinates.
Drawing rectilinear areas whose boundaries are not on pixel boundaries
cannot be guaranteed to be portable. In other words, the "control
points" for a rectangular area are at the corners, while the control
points for a rectilinear path are in the center of the path, not at the
corners. Therefore, in order for a path and an area to abut seamlessly,
the coordinates of the path must be offset from the coordinates of the
area by half the thickness of the path.

Permissible alternatives during rendering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some platforms may distinguish between lines of the minimum thinness
from lines that are thicker than that. The two rasterizations depicted
in :ref:`two-examples-of-lines-of-thickness-1` are
both perfectly reasonable rasterizations of tilted lines that are a
single device unit wide. The right-hand line is drawn as a tilted
rectangle, the left as the "thinnest visible" line.

.. _two-examples-of-lines-of-thickness-1:

.. figure:: images/graphics-8.png
   :align: center

   Two examples of lines of thickness 1

For thick lines, a platform may choose to draw the exact tilted fractional
rectangle, or the coordinates of that rectangle might be rounded so that it is
distorted into another polygonal shape. The latter case may be prove to be
faster on some platforms. The two rasterizations depicted in
:ref:`two-examples-of-lines-of-thickness-2` are both reasonable.

.. _two-examples-of-lines-of-thickness-2:

.. figure:: images/graphics-9.png
   :align: center

   Two examples of lines of thickness 2

The decision about which side of the shape to take when a boundary line
passes through the decision point is made arbitrarily, although this is
compatible with the X11 definition. This is not necessarily the most
convenient decision. The main problem with this is illustrated by the
case of a horizontal line (see
:ref:`two-possible-definitions-of-horizontal-lines`).
The DUIM definition draws the rectangular slice above the coordinates,
since those pixels are the ones whose centers have the figure
immediately above them. This definition makes it simpler to draw
rectilinear borders around rectilinear areas.

Drawing using path related functions
====================================

A number of functions are provided that let you perform a number of
connected drawing operations by encapsulating all the operations as a
single path, rendering the graphic itself only when the whole path has
been defined explicitly. You can use these functions by following the
general procedure below:

1. Create a new path using :gf:`start-path`.
2. Define the appearance of the path using any combination of :gf:`line-to`,
   :gf:`move-to`, :gf:`curve-to`, and :gf:`arc-to`.
3. Optionally, use :gf:`close-path` to create a closed path from the
   segments defined in step 2 above.
4. End the current path definition using :gf:`end-path` (if you have not
   already used :gf:`close-path`).
5. Render the outline of the path to the drawable object using
   :gf:`stroke-path`.
6. If the path you created is closed, flood fill the path using
   :gf:`fill-path`.

Each of these functions is described in a little more in the following
sections. For full details about each individual function, refer to its
full reference entry in `DUIM-Graphics Module`_.

Functions for controlling the definition of a path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following generic functions provide overall control of the
definition of a path. In each case, the argument *drawable* is either a
sheet or a medium.

.. generic-function:: start-path

   :signature: start-path *drawable* => ()

   :description:

     Starts a new path on *drawable*. The path can be created with any
     number of calls to :gf:`line-to`, :gf:`curve-to`, :gf:`arc-to`,
     and :gf:`move-to`.  Its appearance can also be manipulated using
     :gf:`fill-path` and :gf:`stroke-path`.

     After creating the path, use either :gf:`close-path` or :gf:`end-path` to
     finish the path, or :gf:`abort-path` to abandon it altogether.

.. generic-function:: end-path

   :signature: end-path *drawable* => ()

   :description:

     Ends the definition of the current path in *drawable*. Once the
     definition has been ended, the path can be rendered to the drawable
     using :gf:`fill-path` or :gf:`stroke-path`.

     The function :gf:`close-path` can also be used to end the definition of a
     path.

.. generic-function:: close-path

   :signature: close-path *drawable* => ()

   :description:

     Closes the current path on the *drawable*: that is, creates a closed
     figure from the elements already defined.

     For example, if you create a path that has four connected lines (using
     :gf:`line-to`), you can use :gf:`close-path` to join the first and last lines
     in the path to create a closed, five-sided figure.

.. generic-function:: abort-path

   :signature: abort-path *drawable* => ()

   :description:

     Aborts the current path on *drawable*. Any operations that have been
     performed since the last call to *start-path* are discarded.

.. generic-function:: fill-path

   :signature: fill-path *drawable* => ()

   :description:

     Uses the current brush to fill the current path on *drawable*. Only
     closed paths can be filled. If the path has not already been closed
     using :gf:`close-path`, it is closed
     automatically.

.. generic-function:: stroke-path

   :signature: stroke-path *drawable* => ()

   :description:

     Uses the current pen to draw the current path on *drawable*. Note that
     the path must not have been previously filled. This function does not
     close the path: you must use :gf:`close-path` if you wish to do this.

Functions for describing the appearance of a path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following generic functions actually perform drawing operations
within a path. Again, in each case, the argument *drawable* is either a
sheet or a medium. All other arguments are instances of :drm:`<real>`.

.. generic-function:: line-to

   :signature: line-to *drawable x y* => ()

   :description:

     Draws a line from the current position in the path to (*x*, *y*).

.. generic-function:: curve-to

   :signature: curve-to *drawable x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3* => ()

   :description:

     Draws a curve in the current path on *drawable* starting from the
     current position, and passing through (*x1*, *y1*), (*x2*, *y2*), and
     (*x3*, *y3*).

.. generic-function:: move-to

   :signature: move-to *drawable x y* => ()

   :description:

     Move the position in the current path on *drawable* to (*x*, *y*).

     The function :gf:`move-to` can be used several times within the definition
     of a path, allowing for the definition of several visually separate
     sections within the same path.

.. generic-function:: arc-to

   :signature: arc-to *drawable center-x center-y radius-1-dx radius-1-dy radius-2-dx radius-2-dy* #key *start-angle end-angle* => ()

   :description:

     Draws an arc in the current path on *drawable*.

     .. figure:: images/graphics-11.png
        :align: center

     Description of the arguments for arc-to

     The center of the arc is defined by (*center-x*, *center-y*), the
     points furthest away from the center for each radius are calculated by
     adding *radius-1-dx* and *radius-1-dy* to *center-x* and *center-y*
     respectively (to calculate the outermost points for the first radius),
     and adding *radius-2-dx* and *radius-2-dy* to *center-x* and *center-y*
     respectively (to calculate the outermost points for the second radius).

     The arguments *start-angle* and *end-angle* define the extent of the arc
     that is drawn.

     For each function listed above, an equivalent function is also provided
     that passes composite objects in its arguments, rather than separate
     coordinates. These functions take the same name as the functions above,
     but with a ``*`` character appended. (Thus, :gf:`line-to*` performs the same
     operation as :gf:`line-to`, but passes composite objects in its arguments).
     You should be aware that using these composite object functions may lead
     to a loss of performance. For more details, see the full reference
     entries for each function.

DUIM-Graphics Module
====================

This section contains a complete reference of all the interfaces that
are exported from the *duim-graphics* module.

.. generic-function:: abort-path

   Aborts the current path on the specified drawable object.

   :signature: abort-path *drawable* => ()

   :parameter drawable: An instance of type ``type-union(<sheet>, <medium>)``.

   :description:

     Aborts the current path on *drawable*. Any operations that have been
     performed since the last call to :gf:`start-path` are discarded.

   :seealso:

     - :gf:`close-path`
     - :gf:`end-path`
     - :gf:`start-path`

.. generic-function:: arc-to

   Draws an arc in the current path on the specified drawable.

   :signature: arc-to *drawable center-x center-y radius-1-dx radius-1-dy radius-2-dx radius-2-dy* #key *start-angle end-angle* => ()

   :signature: arc-to\* *drawable center radius-1-dx radius-1-dy radius-2-dx radius-2-dy* #key *start-angle end-angle* => ()

   :parameter drawable: An instance of type ``type-union(<sheet>, <medium>)``.
   :parameter radius-1-dx: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter radius-1-dy: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter radius-2-dx: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter radius-2-dy: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter start-angle: An instance of type ``false-or(<real>)``.
   :parameter end-angle: An instance of type ``false-or(<real>)``.

   The following arguments are specific to ``arc-to``.

   :parameter center-x: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter center-y: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.

   The following argument is specific to ``arc-to*``.

   :parameter center: An instance of type :class:`<transform>`.

   :description:

     Draws an arc in the current path on the specified drawable.

     This function is used, in combination with :gf:`line-to`, :gf:`curve-to`,
     and :gf:`move-to`, to define a path. The function :gf:`start-path` should
     be used to start the definition of the path, and :gf:`end-path` can be
     used to finish the definition.

     The center of the arc is defined by (*center-x*, *center-y*), and the
     extreme points of the virtual ellipse around the arc (that is, the
     points furthest away from the center for each radius) are calculated by
     adding the radius vectors *radius-1-dx* and *radius-1-dy* to *center-x*
     and *center-y* respectively (to calculate the outermost points for the
     first radius), and adding the radius vectors *radius-2-dx* and
     *radius-2-dy* to *center-x* and *center-y* respectively (to calculate
     the outermost points for the second radius).

     Please note that :gf:`arc-to` does not currently support arcs whose
     orientation is not axis-aligned ellipses. For all practical purposes,
     this means that *radius-1-dy* and *radius-2-dx* must always be 0.

     .. figure:: images/graphics-12.png
        :align: center

     The arguments *start-angle* and *end-angle* define the extent of the arc
     that is drawn.

     The function ``arc-to*`` is identical to ``arc-to``, except that it passes
     composite objects, rather than separate coordinates, in its arguments.
     You should be aware that using this function may lead to a loss of
     performance.

.. generic-function:: close-path

   Closes the current path on the specified drawable.

   :signature: close-path *drawable* => ()

   :parameter drawable: An instance of type ``type-union(<sheet>, <medium>)``.

   :description:

     Closes the current path on the *drawable*: that is, creates a closed
     figure from the elements already defined.

     For example, if you create a path that has four connected lines (using
     :gf:`line-to`), you can use :gf:`close-path` to join the first and last lines
     in the path to create a closed, five-sided figure.

     Only closed paths can be filled, although :gf:`fill-path` will close
     a non-closed path automatically.

.. generic-function:: copy-area

   Copies a rectangle of pixels from a specified medium to the same medium.

   :signature: copy-area *medium from-x from-y width height to-x to-y* #key *function* => ()

   :parameter medium: An instance of type :class:`<medium>`.
   :parameter from-x: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter from-y: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter width: An instance of type :drm:`<integer>`.
   :parameter height: An instance of type :drm:`<integer>`.
   :parameter to-x: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter to-y: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter function: An instance of type :drm:`<function>`. Default value: :const:`$boole-1`.
   


   :description:

     Copies the pixels from the *medium* starting at the position specified
     by (*from-x*, *from-y*) to the position (*to-x*, *to-y*) on the same
     medium. A rectangle whose width and height is specified by *width* and
     *height* is copied. If *medium* is a medium or a stream, then the x and
     y values are transformed by the user transformation. The copying must be
     done by *medium-copy-copy*.

   :seealso:

.. generic-function:: copy-from-pixmap

   Copies a rectangle of pixels from the specified pixmap to the specified
   medium.

   :signature: copy-from-pixmap *pixmap pixmap-x pixmap-y width height medium medium-x medium-y* #key *function* => ()

   :parameter pixmap: An instance of type :class:`<pixmap>`.
   :parameter pixmap-x: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter pixmap-y: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter width: An instance of type :drm:`<integer>`.

   :parameter medium-y: An instance of type :class:`<coordinate>`.
   :parameter function: An instance of type :drm:`<function>`. Default value: :const:`$boole-1`.

   :description:

     Copies a rectangle of pixels from *pixmap* starting at the position
     specified by (*pixmap-x*, *pixmap-y*) into *medium* at the position
     (*medium-x*, *medium-y*). A rectangle whose width and height is
     specified by *width* and *height* is copied. If *medium* is a medium or
     a stream, then *medium-x* and *medium-y* are transformed by the user
     transformation. The copying must be done by *medium-copy-copy*.

     The center of the ellipse is defined by (*center-x*, *center-y*), and
     the extreme points of the ellipse (that is, the points furthest away
     from the center for each radius) are calculated by adding the radius
     vectors *radius-1-dx* and *radius-1-dy* to *center-x* and *center-y*
     respectively (to calculate the outermost points for the first radius),
     and adding the radius vectors *radius-2-dx* and *radius-2-dy* to
     *center-x* and *center-y* respectively (to calculate the outermost
     points for the second radius).

     Please note that *draw-ellipse* does not currently support
     non-axis-aligned ellipses. For all practical purposes, this means that
     *radius-1-dy* and *radius-2-dx* must always be 0.

   :signature: draw-rectangles *drawable coord-seq* #key *filled?* => ()
   :signature: draw-rectangles\* *drawable points* #key *filled?* => ()

   :parameter drawable: An instance of type ``type-union(<sheet>, <medium>)``.
   :parameter filled?: An instance of type :drm:`<boolean>`. Default value: ``#t``.

   The following argument is specific to ``draw-rectangles``.

   The following argument is specific to ``draw-rectangles*``.

   :parameter points: An instance of type ``limited(<sequence>, of: <point>)``.

   :description:

     Draws a sequence of rectangles on *drawable* with left and right corners
     at the specified positions, using the current pen. Dashed lines start
     dashing at the starting point of the first segment of each rectangle.

     If *filled?* is ``#t`` then the rectangles will be filled, using the
     current brush.

     The function ``draw-rectangles*`` is identical to ``draw-rectangles``,
     except that it passes composite objects, rather than separate
     coordinates, in its arguments. You should be aware that using this
     function may lead to a loss of performance.

   :parameter towards-x: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter towards-y: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter x: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.
   :parameter y: An instance of type :drm:`<real>`.

   The following arguments are specific to ``draw-text*``.

   :parameter towards-point: An instance of type :class:`<transform>`.
   :parameter point: An instance of type :class:`<transform>`.

   :description:

     Draws text from *text* on *drawable* at (*x*, *y*). Text is drawn in
     the direction of the point (*towards-x*, *towards-y*).

     .. figure:: images/graphics-18.png
        :align: center

     If *start* and *end* are specified, then only a section of text is
     drawn, starting at character *start*, and ending with character *end*.
     By default, the whole of *text* is drawn.

     The *align-x* and *align-y* arguments let you specify the left-right
     alignment and the top-bottom alignment (respectively) of the text that
     is written to *drawable*.

     For *align-x*, the whole of the distance between (*x*, *y*) and
     (*towards-x*, *towards-y*) is used to align *text*. Thus, if *align-x*
     is *#"right"*, the text will appear closer to (*towards-x*, *towards-y*)
     than to (*x*, *y*), assuming *text* occupies less space than the
     distance between these two points.

     The argument *transform-glyphs?* controls whether the text is reversed
     in cases when *towards-x* is less than *x*. If *transform-glyphs?* is
     ``#t``, then text is reversed in these cases, that is, the last character
     of *text* to be written is still closest to the point (*towards-x*,
     *towards-y*), and the text appears reversed. If *transform-glyphs?* is
     ``#f``, then the first character of *text* to be written is closest to
     the point (*towards-x*, *towards-y*), and the text does not appear
     reversed.

     If *do-tabs?* is ``#t``, then any tab characters in *text* are honored,
     and are drawn as tabs. If *do-tabs?* is ``#f``, then tab characters are
     replaced by spaces.

     The function ``draw-text*`` is identical to ``draw-text``, except that it
     passes composite objects, rather than separate coordinates, in its
     arguments. You should be aware that using this function may lead to a
     loss of performance.

     This function is used, in combination with :gf:`move-to`, :gf:`curve-to`,
     and :gf:`arc-to`, to define a path. The function :gf:`start-path` should
     be used to start the definition of the path, and :gf:`end-path` can be
     used to finish the definition.

     The function ``line-to*`` is identical to ``line-to``, except that it

   The class of pixmap objects.

   :superclasses: :class:`<image>`

   :description:

     The class of pixmap objects.

     A pixmap can be thought of as an "off-screen window", that is, a medium
     that can be used for graphical output, but is not visible on any display
     device. Pixmaps are provided to allow you to generate a piece of output
     associated with some display device that can then be rapidly drawn on
     a real display device. For example, an electrical CAD system might
     generate a pixmap that corresponds to a complex, frequently used part in
     a VLSI schematic, and then use :class:`copy-from-pixmap` to draw the part
     as needed.
