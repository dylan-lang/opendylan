Abstract
========

Dylan string literals have two deficiencies when compared to many current
programming languages, most notably the inability to encode multi-line strings
into a single source token that crosses multiple source lines and no fully
supported way to represent unescaped ("raw") strings. This DEP proposes a
literal syntax for both of these cases. Briefly, it proposes syntax for
one-line raw strings delimited by ``#r"``, multi-line strings delimited by
``"""`` and ``#r"""``, and quoted symbols delimited by ``#"""``.


Rationale
=========

Summary: Literal syntax to address both of these deficiencies would be nice to
have and is something that people expect to exist in modern programming
languages.

Multi-line String Literals
--------------------------

While it should be noted that encoding long string literals into source code is
not good practice when internationalization is desired, it is convenient to
have this ability for quick scripts, for encoding test data, and as simple
format string templates.  Most modern programming languages provide this
ability.

For very short multi-line strings it is reasonable to use \\n in a regular string::

  "line one\nline two"

but readability quickly suffers as these strings get longer and more complex.  An
alternative is to put one string on each line and rely on automatic string concatenation
by the compiler::

  "line one\n"
  "line two"

However, changing the contents of the string quickly becomes an
editing chore as the programmer attempts to keep the lines a similar length,
and to remember to put the \\n at the end of each line.  Having a multi-line
string literal syntax would alleviate both of these problems.

Raw String Literals
-------------------

Raw string literals (that is, strings in which ``'\\'`` is not a special
character) are useful for inputting data that needs to contain many ``'\\'``
characters. The primary example of this is regular expressions, which quickly
become difficult to interpret when they themselves contain many backslashes.

Open Dylan has a fairly simple work-around for this problem, which it calls
:doc:`parser expansions
</library-reference/language-extensions/parser-expansions>`:

.. code:: dylan

   define function string-parser (s) s end;
   define constant s1 = "\\.\\[\\*\\\\\\]";     // standard Dylan
   define constant s2 = #:string:"\.\[\*\\\]";  // uses string-parser

There are some problems with this mechanism:

#. Because the parser can have any name ("string" in the above example) and
   various different delimiters, it's difficult to provide good editor support.
   Similarly, the name may not be obvious to future code maintainers.

#. The parser only allows a single character to delimit the string, meaning
   that that character is forbidden within the string literal.  For long string
   literals it can be hard to predict which delimiter character (if any) will
   not be used in the string.

#. For the relatively common task of specifying a raw string, each individual
   library needs to either define ``string-parser`` or import it. (This could
   be made easier by exporting it from the ``common-dylan`` module.)

#. This kind of parser prevents consecutive string literal concatenation by the
   compiler because the reader doesn't produce a string literal fragment for
   it.  Instead it emits a call to ``string-parser``.

Having a standard raw string literal syntax would eliminate or reduce these
problems.


Specification
=============

Multi-line string literals are delimited by *at least* three double quote characters on
each end: ``"""``. Any string literal, whether one-line or multi-line, may be prefixed
with ``#r`` or ``#R`` to disable backslash escape processing, i.e., to make it a "raw"
string literal.

.. note::

   Although we refer to "multi-line" string literals for convenience, because spanning
   multiple lines is their primary purpose, they are not *required* to span multiple
   lines.  For example, ``"""print("foo")"""`` is a perfectly valid "multi-line" string
   even though it contains no Newline characters.  They could just as well be called
   "multi-quoted" strings.

Literal end-of-line sequences are always interpreted as a single LF character,
in both raw and escaped string literals, regardless of operating system
platform. Specifically,

#. CR (character code 13) by itself is converted to a single LF (character code
   10).

#. CRLF (character codes 13 10, when occurring consecutively) are converted to
   a single LF (character code 10).

An implication of this design is that the only way to include a CR character in
a string literal is with the escape sequence ``\r`` in a non-raw string.

All string literals, whether escaped, raw, one-line, or multi-line, continue to
adhere to the rule that consecutive string literals separated by only
whitespace are automatically concatenated.

Because Dylan's quoted symbol syntax (also known as "unique string" syntax) is just ``#``
followed by any standard string, we also allow ``#"""`` to indicate a multi-line quoted
symbol. No new syntax is provided to create "raw" quoted symbols, i.e., quoted symbols
without escape processing.

The Rectangle Rule
------------------

`The Rectangle Rule
<https://github.com/google/google-java-format/wiki/The-Rectangle-Rule>`_ states

  When a source file is formatted, each subtree gets its own bounding
  rectangle, containing all of that subtree’s text and none of any other
  subtree’s.

To permit (but not require) Dylan source code to conform to that rule,
multi-line string literals need special treatment of leading whitespace. In the
following two examples the programmer wants to ensure that there is no leading
whitespace on any line in the resulting string literal token:

.. code-block:: dylan
   :linenos:
   :caption: Without support for the Rectangle Rule
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

   define method foo ()
     let text = """bits on the wire
   protocols well understood
   where did my mail go?
   """;
     ...
   end method;

Here, without special handling for leading whitespace, there is no choice but
to put the first line of text on the same line with ``"""`` and to left-align
the highlighted lines, harming readability due to violating the Rectangle Rule.

.. code-block:: dylan
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,6
   :caption: With support for the Rectangle Rule

   define method foo ()
     let text = """
                bits on the wire
                protocols well understood
                where did my mail go?
                """;
     ...
   end method;

Here, the ``\n`` (and any other whitespace) after the opening delimiter is
removed and leading whitespace is removed from the highlighted lines in the
resulting string literal token, so they may be moved (as a unit) left or right
without affecting the result.

To achieve this we adopt the techniques used for `raw strings in C#
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-11.0/raw-string-literal>`_.
See same for many examples.

The following rules summarize the above C# specification, and they apply to both raw and
non-raw multi-line string literals:

* Starts and ends with a sequence of *at least* three double quote characters
  (``"""``, ``#r"""``, or ``#R"""``). More than three consecutive ``"``
  characters are allowed to start and end the sequence in order to support
  string literals that contain three (or more) repeated ``"`` characters.

* Single line string literals that use ``"""`` allow the opening and closing delimiters
  to be on the same line.

* In multi-line string literals, any whitespace to the left of the closing
  delimiter is removed from all lines of the string literal.

* In multi-line string literals, whitespace to the left of the closing delimiter must be
  identical on each line.  Specifically, it is not valid to use tab characters in the
  prefix on one line and space characters on another.  There is one exception to this
  rule: a completely blank source code line is treated as though it contains only the
  correct prefix. This is to prevent requiring end-of-line whitespace, which may not
  interact well with some editors or style rules.

* In multi-line string literals, whitespace following the opening delimiter on
  the same line is ignored.

* In multi-line string literals, whitespace-only lines following the opening
  delimiter are included in the string literal.

BNF

In the Dylan Reference Manual, in the section `Tokens
<https://opendylan.org/books/drm/Lexical_Grammar#HEADING-117-3>`_, ``#r`` is
added to the ``#-word`` production.

The BNF, which augments `Character and String Literals
<https://opendylan.org/books/drm/Lexical_Grammar#HEADING-117-38>`_ in the DRM,
is shown below.

Examples
--------

``"""x"""`` is equivalent to ``"x"``.


The empty string written on multiple lines::

  """

  """

The above can be unintuitive at first. If we use ``|`` to indicate the beginning and end
of the string content, the above is just

::

  """
  ||
  """

which is the empty string.

The following is a syntax error because multi-line string literals must have at least one
line, even if it is empty::

  """
  """

Strings equivalent to ``"abc"``::

  """abc"""
  """""""abc"""""""
  #r"abc"
  #R"""abc"""

  """
  abc
  """

  #r"""
  abc
  """

Multi-line string equivalent to ``"line one\nline two"``::

  let text = """
             line one
             line two
             """;

Same as above because there is no requirement for each line to align vertically with the
**open** delimiter::

  let text = """
        line one
        line two
        """;

Multi-line string equivalent to ``"\nline one\nline two\n"``::

  let text = """

             line one
             line two

             """;

Same as above but using escape sequences::

  let text = """
             \nline one
             line two\n
             """;

Equivalent to ``"let x = \"foo\";"``::

  """let x = "foo";"""

Equivalent to ``format-out("""%s""")``::

  """"
  format-out("""%s""")
  """"

Raw string equivalent to ``C:\users\``::

  #R"C:\users\"

Equivalent to ``"^\\s*([0-9A-Fa-f]+)\\s*"``::

  #r"^\s*([0-9A-Fa-f]+)\s*"


Reference Implementation
