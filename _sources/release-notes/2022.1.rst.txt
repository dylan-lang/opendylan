Open Dylan 2022.1
*****************

This document describes the 2022.1 release of Open Dylan, released 28
November, 2022.  This release contains many enhancements and bug fixes,
highlights of which are listed below.  For complete details see `the opendylan
commit logs
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/compare/v2020.1.0...v2022.1.0>`_.

.. note:: Some commit logs, for example for testworks and other libraries that
          are included in Open Dylan as git submodules, may be in other
          repositories.

Compiler
========

* Fixed a crash in the optimizer that occurred when compiling certain
  C-FFI primitive functions.

* Improved support for code generation of ``apply`` calls to known
  methods.

* Improved source line tracking in the generated code, reducing the
  occurrence of code marked as being at line 0 by the debugger.

* Added support for linking executable Dylan libraries and all of
  their dependencies into a single unified executable using the
  ``-unify`` build option. The unified executable will be stored in
  the :file:`sbin` (static executables binary) directory of the
  personal-root, normally ``./_build/sbin/``.

* Fixed a build script problem that caused separate debug information
  to be lost on FreeBSD platforms (or others using ``llvm-strip`` as
  the default ``strip`` program).

* Fixed a problem with certain types of multiple-value return (`bug 1455
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1455>`_).

* Fixed a problem with the optimization of functions that tail-call
  themselves.

* To aid with automation tasks the ``dylan-compiler`` and ``dylan-environment``
  executables now return exit code ``3`` if any serious warnings are
  generated. Use the new ``-allow-serious-warnings`` flag to return to the old
  behavior of returning exit code ``0``.

Tooling
=======

* The ``dylan`` command (renamed to <https://github.com/dylan-lang/deft>`_ in
  Open Dylan 2025.1) is a new tool to manage Dylan packages and workspaces. It
  provides a centralized catalog of Dylan packages and a way to manage
  dependencies without resorting to Git submodules or needing to manually
  create registry files.

  .. note:: Since this release, dylan-tool was renamed to "deft". See the `deft
            documentation <https://package.opendylan.org/deft/>` for details.

  .. note:: This tool is still in the relatively early stages of development.

Run-time
========

* Fixed a problem that prevented treating invalid keyword arguments as
  run-time warnings (`bug 1386
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1386>`_)

* Changed the run-time on x86_64 Linux to stop catching the SIGSEGV signal.

Platform Support
================

* The 64-bit RISC-V architecture (rv64gc ISA) is now supported on Linux.

IDE
===

* A bug that caused error pop-up dialogs whenever the cursor was moved
  in an interactor window has been fixed.

Documentation
=============

* :doc:`/corba-guide/index` has been updated.

* Documentation for the DOOD library has been added to :doc:`the library
  reference </library-reference/dood/index>`.

* Documentation for the internal ``access-path`` and ``debugger-manager``
  libraries is now available in the :doc:`/hacker-guide/index`.

Library Changes
===============

common-dylan Library
--------------------

* ``integer-to-string`` has a new *lowercase?* keyword argument. When true,
  lowercase characters are used when *base* is above 10.

* ``string-to-integer`` performance has been improved.

io Library
----------

* The behavior of the ``%x`` format directive has changed. "%x" now outputs
  lowercase hexadecimal numbers and "%X" outputs uppercase. The old behavior
  was to always output uppercase. Fixes `bug 1054
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1054>`_.

system Library
--------------

* A segmentation fault when using ``list-locator`` was fixed (`bug 1372
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1372>`_).

* Function ``file-locator``, to create a file locator as a child of a directory
  locator, is now exported from the locators module.

ssl Library
-----------

The ``ssl-network`` library has been updated for compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.x.

testworks Library
-----------------

* The new function ``write-test-file`` simplifies the creation of test files.

* ``test-temp-directory`` now handles test names containing ``/``.  This is
  important for tests using the naming convention ``test-foo/subtest1``,
  ``test-foo/subtest2``.


collections Library
-------------------

* The ``table`` macro has been renamed to ``tabling``. ``table`` is not an
  unlikely name for a function parameter when writing code that generically
  operates on tables, and the existence of the ``table`` macro causes a
  confusing compiler warning for references to that name that aren't in the
  correct form.
