Compiler
========

* The default compiler-back-end is now selected by querying the
  ``SUPPORTED_COMPILER_BACK_ENDS`` build system variable, normally set
  at configuration time within the ``config.jam`` build script:

  .. code-block:: 

      SUPPORTED_COMPILER_BACK_ENDS ?= llvm c ;

  At build time, if the selected back-end is not supported by the
  build-system configuration, a warning will be issued.

  The default back-end, when it is available, is now LLVM.

* In the LLVM back-end, improved alignment information is supplied to
  the ``llvm.memcpy`` intrinsic.

* A new ``primitive-the`` primitive function is supported as an
  annotation that allows the compiler to assume that a value has the
  given type. These annotations were also added to the ``dylan``
  library at various frequently-executed expressions where the
  compiler is otherwise unable to infer the type, reducing the number
  of run-time type checks when using the LLVM back-end.

* Optimization for cases where the :drm:`instance?` function is used in
  an ``if`` or ``case`` condition has been improved.

* A bug in the LLVM back-end that could cause stack overflows in
  long-running functions has been fixed.

* The C back-end now uses C99 hexadecimal floating-point constants in
  its output to prevent loss of precision due to decimal conversion.

* A `longstanding bug
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1068>`_ in an
  attempted optimization that caused spurious serious warnings when
  compiling the Dylan library has been fixed.

* A `failure <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1239>`_ of
  code generated by the LLVM back-end to detect integer overflows
  resulting from arithmetic shifts has been fixed.

* A failure to detect argument mismatches when known functions are
  called using :drm:`apply` has been fixed.

* Calls to functions that do not return are now properly recognized by
  the LLVM code generator.

* The failure of the LLVM back-end to include NUL termination in
  :drm:`<byte-string>` instances in the generated heap has been
  fixed. (NUL termination is added so that string data can be passed
  to FFI functions without requiring allocation and copying.)

* Compiler error messages now include column numbers (in `GNU standard
  format <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Errors.html>`_)
  when referring to source locations. Debug information generated by
  the LLVM back-end also includes column numbers.

* The compiler can now output etags-format TAGS tables using the
  ``export tags`` command.

* The command-line compiler now displays a text mode progress bar
  during the compilation and link phases.

* The compiler no longer generates dispatch coloring information in
  Emacs Lisp format by default. When it is needed, it can still be
  requested by supplying the ``-dispatch-coloring elisp`` command-line
  option at build time. (Note that the IDE dispatch coloring display
  does not make use of the elisp-format files.)

* The LLVM back-end now tracks function inlining in generated debug
  information, allowing breakpoints to be set in inlined code. (Note,
  however, that functions inlined from the ``dylan`` library are
  excluded.)

* The HARP back-end is no longer supported on x86 Linux because it is
  not able to maintain the stack alignment that C code requires on
  that platform.

* A bug that prevented the error output of build commands (such as the
  linker) from appearing in :file:`build.log` files and the console output
  has been fixed.

Run-time
========

* An error in the LLVM run-time which prevented call-site method
  dispatch caches from being used has been fixed. This change
  significantly improves the performance of code using the LLVM
  back-end.

* Support for ``apply-mep`` method entry (used for calling a known
  method using :drm:`apply` when next-methods of the call are known)
  was added to the LLVM run-time.

* The interpretation of ``decode-double-float`` and
  ``encode-double-float`` on 64-bit platforms has changed, so that 32
  bits of the :drm:`<double-float>` value are found in each of the two
  ``<machine-word>`` values. Previously (on 64-bit platforms) the entire
  64 bits were placed in one ``<machine-word>`` and the other contained
  zeroes. This change fixes `bug 1254
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1254>`_.

* A `problem <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1285>`_
  with thread exit that could cause thread finalization cycle warnings
  from the garbage collector has been fixed.

* The LLVM run-time on 32-bit x86 platforms now clears the x87 stack
  when handling exceptions to prevent overflowing the 8-slot FPU
  stack.

Platform Support
================

* The AArch64 (64-bit ARM) platform is now supported on Linux.

* The 32-bit x86-darwin platform is no longer supported, since macOS 10.15
  (Catalina) and later can no longer support running 32-bit
  applications.

IDE
===

* The Visual SourceSafe source control interface for the Windows
  environment has been removed.

CORBA
=====

* The Scepter IDL compiler can now ``#include`` files via symbolic
  links.

* Scepter IDL compiler ``#include`` file open errors are now properly
  signaled.

* Problems with Portable Object Adapter shutdown have been fixed.

* The ``TypeCode`` type predefined by Scepter now appears in the
  ``CORBA`` IDL module.

* IDL forward declarations of structures and unions are now properly
  supported.

* Typecode marshalling and interpretation has been fixed.

* The CORBA run-time and the IDL compiler now support ``long long``
  and ``unsigned long long`` types.

* Marshalling of sequences and arrays to ``<Any>`` pseudo-objects is
  now supported by the CORBA run-time.

* The deprecated IOP field ``requesting_principal`` is now filled in
  with a empty octet sequence, fixing interoperability with other
  ORBs.

* ``LocateReply`` responses sent from a POA have been fixed.

* The Scepter and CORBA runtime unit tests have been improved.

* The CORBA demo applications have been updated.

* References in the source code to "Functional Developer ORB"
  are now updated to "Open Dylan ORB".

DUIM
====

* The obsolete ``GDK_SOLID`` constant is no longer referenced from the
  DUIM back-end for GTK.

GTK
===

* The obsolete ``gdk-pixbuf-gettext`` function is no longer included
  in the GTK bindings.

* A type error that prevented GObject casts from working properly has
  been fixed.

Debugging
=========

* The LLDB debugger support has been updated to work with Python 3.  For more
  information, see :doc:`Debugging with GDB or LLDB
  </getting-started-cli/debugging-with-gdb-lldb>`.

Documentation
=============

* Dylan Reference Manual links were added to :doc:`An Introduction to Dylan
  </intro-dylan/index>`.

* Index sections were added to :doc:`Getting Started with the Open Dylan IDE
  </getting-started-ide/index>`, :doc:`Building Applications With DUIM
  </building-with-duim/index>`.

Build System
============

* The build system now reliably detects when changes have been made to
  Jamfile sources while the environment is running.

* The ``fdmake.pl`` build tool used during bootstrapping was improved
  so that it can build multiple libraries for each invocation of
  :program:`dylan-compiler`, significantly reducing the time required
  to do bootstrap builds.

Library Changes
===============

dylan Library
-------------

* A bug that broke ``limited(<array>)`` instantiation has been fixed.

common-dylan Library
--------------------

* The simple-io module has been removed.  This module was deprecated in Open
  Dylan 2014.1 and is replaced by the simple-format module.

* The performance of the ``join`` method was improved.

* The ``split`` function now signals an error when called with an empty
  separator (e.g., the empty string) or with a separator function that
  returns start/end indices that are equal.

io Library
----------

* A longstanding bug in the tab position computation used by the
  ``pprint-tab`` function is now fixed.

* The unit tests for the pprint and print modules were improved.

* ``*print-escape?*`` and the ``escape?`` parameter for the ``print`` function
  have been documented.

* The ``printing-object`` macro has been documented.

system Library
--------------

* Library initialization under the LLVM back-end has been changed to
  enable using the ``load-library`` function on all supported
  platforms.

* The ``load-library`` function will now signal an :drm:`<error>` if it fails.

* A `bug in delete-directory:file-system:system
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1227>`_ was fixed.

* A `bug <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1284>`_ that
  prevented file open failures from being detected on 64-bit platforms
  has been fixed.

* A bug that affected the ``file-type`` function on macOS has been fixed.

* The ``run-application:operating-system:system`` function has changed to
  accept the command as a :drm:`<sequence>` instead of a limited type.  This
  simplifies the specification of the command at the call site.

* There have been several improvements to the ``locators`` module:

  * Locators always show the path when printed, for improved debugging.

  * ``simplify-locator`` now resolves ``..`` correctly.

  * The ``resolve-locator`` function has been added. It is similar to
    ``simplify-locator`` but also resolves links in the file system.

  * ``merge-locators`` now correctly handles merging a directory locator from a
    file locator that has no directory component. Example::

      merge-locators(as(<directory-locator>, "a/"),
                     as(<file-locator>, "b"))
        => {<file-locator> "a/b"}

  * ``merge-locators`` no longer calls ``simplify-locator``. Because the
    semantics of simplifying a locator depend on whether or not the file system
    is checked (i.e., ``simplify-locator`` vs ``resolve-locator``) it is left
    to end-user code to decide whether and how to do it.

c-ffi Library
-------------

* The import mapping for types such as ``<C-int>`` has been changed to
  return a ``<abstract-integer>`` (as per the original design) rather
  than ``<machine-word>``. The Win32 and OLE interface libraries were
  modified to accommodate this change.

* LLVM code generation for C-FFI code that requires type casting or
  sign extension has been fixed.

network library
---------------

* A deadlock that occurred when shutting down listening socket threads
  has been fixed.

* Error code generation on BSD operating systems has been fixed.

testworks Library
-----------------

* A new executable library, testworks-run, can be used to run any test library
  compiled as a shared library. On Linux, ``testworks-run --load
  libmy-test-library.so``.

* The testworks-specs library has been folded into testworks and has been
  greatly simplified. See `Interface Specification Suites
  <https://package.opendylan.org/testworks/usage.html#interface-specification-suites>`_. Note
  that the new specification suites no longer expect you to define one test per
  exported name in your interface module. Instead you can write tests in
  whatever way best suits your needs and the interface specification suite only
  verifies that the specification matches the implementation.

* A new function has been added to retrieve a unique directory for the current
  test: :func:`test-temp-directory`

* The `--report` command line option now accepts "full" as a value, meaning to
  display individual assertion results in addition to the normal output.

* Support for benchmarks has been improved. A new ``benchmark-repeat``
  macro for use within testworks runs its body multiple times, causing
  the "full" report to display basic statistics characterizing the
  benchmark execution.

* The output for several assertions has been made less verbose.

* Use ``--report json`` to generate reports in JSON format. These are much like
  the XML reports but less verbose.

* ``--report log`` has been removed. Use ``--report json`` or ``--report xml``
  instead.

* The `testworks-report` library has received some love and is now able to parse
  json and xml reports.

* An error is signalled if two tests are defined with the same name. (Note that
  when using combined test suites, or using the ``--load`` testworks-run option
  multiple times the names of **all** loaded tests and suites must be unique.)

* When a test has no assertions it receives a "not implemented" result. This is
  now considered to be a passing result rather than failing. The reasoning is
  that "not implemented" should be a reminder to implement the test (so it is
  still displayed prominently in the test output) but it should not obscure
  real test failures in the results. Tests that fail constantly because they're
  unimplemented are not very useful.

collections Library
-------------------

* A warning displayed when compiling the collections library with the
  LLVM back-end has been fixed.

big-integers library
--------------------

* The ``integer-length`` function is now implemented for ``<double-integer>``.

progress-stream library
-----------------------

* :doc:`A new library </library-reference/progress-stream/index>` for
  displaying text mode progress bars is provided.

gabriel-benchmarks library
--------------------------

* The Gabriel benchmarks have been improved and brought in line with
  the Common Lisp `cl-bench
  <https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/ansi-test/cl-bench>`_ project, and
  now make use of the Testworks benchmarking facilities.
