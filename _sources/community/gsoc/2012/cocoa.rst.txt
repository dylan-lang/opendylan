=============
Dylan / Cocoa
=============

The purpose of this project is to use Apple's *Bridge Support* to assist
in generating wrappers around the Cocoa libraries. This would include
the creation of a bridge between Dylan and Objective C using the low
level C API provided by Objective C's runtime.
