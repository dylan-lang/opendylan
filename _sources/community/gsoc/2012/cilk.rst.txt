============
Dylan / Cilk
============

The purpose of this project would be to provide a library and compiler
plugin that transforms Dylan code into a form where it can work with the
Cilk runtime.

Another approach would be to implement our own form of Cilk rather than
trying to interoperate with the existing Cilk runtime.
