============
Dylan / Gtk+
============

The purpose of this project is to:

- Use the ``.gir`` files from `gobject-introspection`_ to generate Gtk+ bindings.
- Use the bindings to implement a backend for DUIM that runs on Linux and Mac OS X.

Some code already exists for this:

- https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/tree/master/sources/gtk
