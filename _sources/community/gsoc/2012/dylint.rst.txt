DyLint
======

The purpose of this project is to create a framework for doing analysis
and warnings of Dylan code using compiler plugins that can walk the
internal compiler datastructures.

This can draw inspiration from:

- `PMD <https://web.archive.org/web/20121222162208/https://pmd.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `PyLint <https://pypi.org/project/pylint/>`_
- Clang plugins
