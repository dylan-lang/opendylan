Connect with the Dylan Community
********************************

The Dylan community is quite small and most of our day-to-day activity takes
place in `the Matrix channels
<https://app.element.io/#/room/#dylan-language:matrix.org>`_. If you don't have
a Matrix account you can sign in with GitHub, GitLab, Google, etc. and use any
Matrix client.

To ask questions about code you can use `play.opendylan.org
<https://play.opendylan.org>`_ to share an example, or `create a gist on
GitHub <https://gist.github.com>`_ and paste a link to it.

How to Contribute
  The :doc:`Hacker Guide <../hacker-guide/index>` has details on how to
  contribute to the project.

Report Bugs
  Bugs may be reported against the `opendylan repository`_ on GitHub. If you know the bug
  is in a specific library repository you can report it there instead. If unsure, use
  `opendylan`_.

Mailing List
  dylan-lang@googlegroups.com, also `browsable on the web
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dylan-lang>`_, is dedicated to discussion of
  Dylan.  If you have a question that's more detailed or doesn't required the quick
  back-and-forth of chat, this is the preferred place for it.

  `comp.lang.dylan
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.dylan>`_ also exists,
  but dylan-lang@ is the preferred forum.
