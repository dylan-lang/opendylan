Why Dylan?
**********

What earthly reason could there be for learning yet
*another* computer language?  And why should that language be
Dylan?

Dylan has an interesting combination of features. It is a dynamic
language, but is designed to perform nearly as well as a static language.
It is a :ref:`functional <functional-languages>` language -- like
Scheme or TCL -- but uses an algebraic infix syntax similar to C's.
Dylan is object-oriented from the ground up, supports multiple 
inheritance and exceptions, implements :doc:`multiple dispatch
<multiple-dispatch>`, and :ref:`collects garbage <garbage-collection>`.

Dynamic vs. Static Languages
============================

Static languages need to know the type of every variable at
compile time. Examples of static languages include C++, Java, and Go.
Code written in static languages typically compiles efficiently, and
strong type-checking at compile-time reduces the risk of errors.

Dynamic languages allow the programmer to create variables
without explicitly specifying the type of information they
contain. This simplifies prototyping and cleans up certain kinds of
object oriented code. Typical dynamic languages include Common Lisp,
Javascript, and Python.

Dylan provides a good balance between the advantages of static and
dynamic languages. The programmer may choose to specify or omit type
declarations as desired. Code using explicit variable types can be
compiled to very efficient code, and type mismatch errors can be
caught at compile time. Code omitting those type declarations gains
the flexibility of a dynamic language.

.. _functional-languages:

Functional Languages
====================

Functional languages, such as Common Lisp,
Scheme and to a large extent TCL, view an entire program as one large
function to be evaluated. Expressions, statements and even control
structures all return values, which may in turn be used as arguments
elsewhere.

Dylan is a functional language, permitting programmers to write
functions like the following:

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method shoe-size (person :: <string>)
      if (person = "Larry")
        14
      else
        11
      end if
    end method;

The function ``shoe-size`` has one argument, a string, and an untyped
return value. (If this function didn't link against external code, the
compiler could easily infer the return type.)  If ``person`` equals
``"Larry"``, then the ``if`` statement returns 14, otherwise it
returns 11. Since no other statements follow the ``if``, its return
value is used as the return value of the entire function.

The same function could also have been written as follows, in a
more imperative idiom:

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method shoe-size (person :: <string>)
      let the-size = 11;
      if (person = "Joe")
        the-size := 14;
      end if;
      the-size
    end method;

Algebraic Infix Syntax
======================

Languages based on LISP typically use a notation called
fully-parenthesized prefix syntax (also known as
s-expressions). This consists of nested parentheses, as seen in the
following Scheme version of the ``shoe-size`` function:

.. code-block:: scheme

    (define (shoe-size person)
      (if (equal? person "Joe")
        14
        11))

This has a certain elegance, but takes some time to learn to read. Dylan,
as shown in :ref:`the previous section <functional-languages>`, uses a
syntax similar to those of C and Pascal.

Object Orientation
==================

Unlike many other object-oriented languages, Dylan uses objects
for every data value. Integers and strings are objects, as are
functions and classes themselves.

Dylan's design makes this reasonably efficient. Compile-time analysis
and explicit :ref:`type declarations <type-declarations>` allow the
compiler to optimize away most of the overhead. Other language features
permit the programmer to mark certain classes as :drm:`sealed <sealing>`, that is,
ineligible for further subclassing.  This allows for further compile-time
optimizations.

Dylan's object model, detailed in the following sections of this
tutorial, differs from that of C++ in several important respects.
Multiple inheritance may be used freely, without concern for
"object slicing", erroneous down-casting or a
whole host of other gotchas familiar to C++ programmers. Methods are
separate from class declarations, allowing a programmer to write new
polymorphic functions without editing the relevant base class.  Methods
may also dispatch polymorphically on more than one parameter, a
powerful technique known as :doc:`multiple dispatch <multiple-dispatch>`.
All of these features will be explained in greater detail later on.

.. _garbage-collection:

Garbage Collection
==================

Languages with garbage collection have no need of a ``free`` or
``delete`` operator, because unused heap memory gets reclaimed automatically
by the language runtime. This reduces the complexity of source code,
eliminates the need of keeping reference counts for shared objects,
and prevents most memory allocation bugs and a major source of memory leaks.

Why Not Dylan?
==============

Dylan's greatest weaknesses are its lack of a battle-hardened compiler
and IDE, and a large user base (and hence a large set of libraries).
However, the compiler and IDE themselves are written in Dylan so there
*are* several hundred thousand lines of Dylan code.  You probably
want to consider very carefully before using Open Dylan for mission
critical code.
