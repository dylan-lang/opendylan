Apple Dylan Technology Release

:doc:`apple-cambridge` ran a preview program circa 1994 inviting
interested developers to work with pre-release versions of :doc:`index`.
This tool was the product of Apple Cambridge, a lab that had hired some
of the best and brightest minds from the Lisp community.

Apple Dylan was best thought of as a proof-of-concept, prototyping
several important complementary developments:

- A highly dynamic and configurable IDE
- A development tool that kept all source code entities in an
  object-oriented database
- The Dylan language
- An early version of the macro system
- A runtime and debugging environment allowing remote debugging,
  compilation and remote execution

It was agonizingly slow, buggy, and not ready to use for serious work,
but also very intriguing, inviting developers to believe that one day
they could live in a development world that offered more than a
nightmare of memory management, environments that don't understand
anything about the code you write with them, and compilers that throw
away almost all of the knowledge they had about your code.

Apple Dylan was eventually made available for sale by Apple as the
*Apple Dylan Technology Release*. The Apple Cambridge lab was closed and
all employees let go. Digitool did some retrofitting to make the
Technology Release work on the PowerPC platform, but that was it. All
that remains are the t-shirts and the dream.

It is still possible to run Apple Dylan on MacOS 9.2.2. See :doc:`today`
for more information.
