Hello World
===========

You have just downloaded Open Dylan and installed it in ``/opt/opendylan``.  So
how do you write the canonical Hello World app?  This example assumes the
``bash`` shell is used.  You may need to adjust for your local shell.  ::

  $ export PATH=/opt/opendylan/bin:$PATH
  $ dylan new application --simple hello-world
  $ cd hello-world
  $ dylan build --all
  ...lots of output...
  $ _build/bin/hello-world
  Hello, world!

Ta da!  Now a quick review of the steps with a little bit of explanation.

First you must set ``PATH`` so that the :program:`dylan` and
:program:`dylan-compiler` commands will be found.  ``./_build/bin`` is where
:program:`dylan-compiler` puts the executables it builds.

.. note:: Some of these differ on Windows, so please be sure
   to read :doc:`windows` if you are on Windows.

``dylan new application --simple hello-world`` creates a directory named
"hello-world", and several files. The ``--simple`` flag says to skip generating
a test suite library.

1. :file:`hello-world.lid` lists the files in the project.  The order in which
   the files are listed here determines the order in which the code in them is
   loaded. The library definition file should always be first.

2. :file:`library.dylan` contains the library and module definitions.  These
   can be extended as your project grows in complexity.

3. :file:`hello-world.dylan` contains the main program code.

4. The :file:`registry` directory is how :program:`dylan-compiler` locates each
   used library. When using the :program:`dylan` tool, this directory is
   generated for you. See :doc:`source-registries` for details on the registry
   format.

5. :file:`dylan-package.json` describes the new "hello-world" package. This is
   where you can specify dependencies, the package location, etc. See the
   `dylan-tool documentation
   <https://docs.opendylan.org/packages/dylan-tool/documentation/source/index.html>`_
   for more on this. Note that the existence of this file turns the
   "hello-world" directory into a :program:`dylan` workspace.

The first time you build ``hello-world`` all used libraries are built, all the
way down to the ``dylan`` library itself. Subsequent builds only need to
recompile ``hello-world`` itself and are therefore much faster.

.. note:: Don't confuse the ``dylan`` library with the :program:`dylan`
          executable program. The ``dylan`` library contains the core Dylan
          language features that are not implemented inside the compiler. The
          ``dylan`` program is a tool to help manager Dylan projects and is
          created from a library called ``dylan-tool``.

The compiler places its output in the ``_build`` directory in the current
working directory. This includes the libraries and executables that it builds.
You can run the executable from this location, as noted above.
