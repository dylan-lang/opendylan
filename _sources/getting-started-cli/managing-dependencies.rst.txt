Managing Dependencies
=====================

We recommend managing inter-library dependencies by use of the Dylan package
manager and the :program:`dylan` tool. When using the :program:`dylan` tool
dependencies are added to the "dylan-package.json" file in your project. Each
dependency includes a `semantic version <https://semver.org>`_ and `dependency
resolution
<https://docs.opendylan.org/packages/dylan-tool/documentation/source/pacman.html#dependency-resolution>`_
is done with "minimal version selection".  See the `dylan-tool`_ documentation
for details.

The second way to manage dependencies is to use Git submodules. The remainder
of this document explains how to do that.

Adding a Git Submodule
----------------------

Git submodules allow you to specify a precise version that you rely upon, but
they assume that everyone is using Git.

We tend to keep all Git submodules in a top level directory
within the repository named ``ext``. To add a new submodule::

  git submodule add <repository URL> ext/<name>

The *repository URL* should be a publicly accessible URL, so
it is recommended to use either the git or https protocols
(``git://`` or ``https://``) rather than SSH (``git@``).

The ``name`` should be the name of the repository.

For example, to add the ``tracing`` library as a submodule::

  git submodule add https://github.com/dylan-foundry/tracing.git ext/tracing

Updating a Git Submodule
------------------------

If the submodule has been updated to point at a new revision, after
you do a ``git pull``, update your submodules with::

  git submodule update --init --recursive

If you want to update the submodule to point to a new revision::

  cd ext/<name>
  git pull --ff-only origin main  # (or master)
  cd ../..
  git add ext/<name>
  git commit -m 'Updated <name> to version xxx.'

Setting Up Registry Entries
---------------------------

For each library that you add as a submodule, create a registry entry so that
the Open Dylan compiler can find the library.  See :doc:`source-registries` for
more detail.

For example, to create a registry entry for the tracing library::

  echo abstract://dylan/ext/tracing/tracing-core/tracing-core.lid \
    > registry/generic/tracing-core

You can usually get a good idea for what registry entries are
needed by looking into the registry directory of the library
that you're using.

Transitive Dependencies
-----------------------

The Dylan compiler won't find transitive dependencies automatically (unless you
are using `dylan-tool`_), so you will need to create registry entries for them
as well.

Sometimes, you will want to create git submodules for them as
well, but other times you can just reference them from the
version that was pulled in with the existing submodule.

As an example, if you pull in the HTTP library, it has
a number of submodules, so you don't need to pull each
of those in directly, but can reference them through
the ``ext/http/`` directory.
