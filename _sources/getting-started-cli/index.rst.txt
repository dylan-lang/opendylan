Getting Started with the Open Dylan Command Line Tools
******************************************************

This guide explains how to use the Open Dylan command-line tools to develop and
deliver Dylan applications.

For help getting started with the IDE (Windows only), see
:doc:`/getting-started-ide/index`.

The compiler executable is called ``dylan-compiler``.  There is a helper
application called :program:`dylan`, which can be used to generate some
boilerplate for a new project, and finally there's ``DIME`` and ``dswank``, a
pair of tools for interactive development in Emacs.  This document describes
these tools.
