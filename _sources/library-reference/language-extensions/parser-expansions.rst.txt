*****************
Parser Expansions
*****************

.. warning:: This is a highly experimental extension. It is not
   well specified, is not supported by any of the editor integrations
   or syntax highlighters, and may change or disappear in the future.

The syntax::

    #:<name>:<text>

gets transformed, setter-like, into::

  <name>-parser(<text>)



The ``<text>`` part can be either *delimited* or *undelimited*. Undelimited
text can contain anything but commas, semicolons, brackets of any kind, and
whitespace. All the following are valid::

    #:http://opendylan.org/
    #:time:12:30am
    #:date:12/3/2000
    #:file:D:\dylan\sources\
    #:mailto:dylan-lang@googlegroups.com

In the delimited form, you have a choice of delimiters: ``"..."``, ``(...)``,
``[...]``, ``{...}``, ``|...|``, ```...```, ``'...'``. Within the delimiters,
only the matching close delimiter must be escaped. The selection allows you to
choose the delimiter requiring least escaping for the enclosed data. The text
(less the delimiters) is passed to the parsing function. Examples::

    #:file:"C:\Program Files\Open Dylan\."
    #:html:{<html>
      <head><title>Foo</title></head>
      <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
      </body>
      </html>}

An example parser:

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method html-parser
        (text :: <byte-string>)
     => (doc :: <html-document>)
       make(<html-document>, text: text)
    end method;

If an appropriate function isn't defined, you get a standard unbound variable
reference message indicating the # literal.

Note that there is no escape processing except that the end delimiter may be
escaped with a backslash and *the escape character itself is not removed*. For
example, ``#:file:"C:\foo\"`` is an error because the end delimiter is escaped
and therefore the hash literal is unterminated. ``#:file:"C:\foo\""`` results
in the literal string ``C:\foo\"`` being passed to the parser.
