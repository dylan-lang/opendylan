Dylan Language Extensions
*************************

The Dylan language is described in `The Dylan Reference Manual
<http://opendylan.org/books/drm/>`_ by Andrew Shalit (Addison-Wesley,
1996). We call this book "the DRM" hereafter.

Open Dylan provides an implementation of the Dylan language
described by the DRM, with a few exceptions that are documented in
:doc:`language-differences`.

Open Dylan provides the Dylan language in the ``dylan`` module of the
``dylan`` library.

This document is an introduction to Open Dylan's extensions to the
Dylan language.  These extensions are either built in to the ``dylan``
library or are available in a separate library, :doc:`common-dylan
<../common-dylan/index>`.

The majority of the extensions are in the :doc:`common-extensions
<../common-dylan/common-extensions>` module
of the :doc:`common-dylan <../common-dylan/index>` library. That library
also exports a number of smaller modules that contain other basic
facilities such as :doc:`simplified formatting <../common-dylan/simple-format>`,
:doc:`pseudo-random integer generation <../common-dylan/simple-random>`,
and :doc:`object finalization <../dylan/finalization>`.

Open Dylan provides a convenience library, ``common-dylan``, that
combines the ``dylan`` and ``common-extensions`` modules to provide a
convenient "dialect" of Dylan, exported from the module ``common-dylan``:

.. code-block:: dylan

    define library common-dylan
      use dylan, export: all;
      use common-extensions, export: all;

      export common-dylan;
    end module;

    define module common-dylan
      use dylan, export: all;
      use common-extensions, export: all;
    end module;

This section describes Dylan language extensions, that is, extensions made to
the Dylan library, and to the base language syntax, as they are defined in the
DRM. These extensions are available to applications in the ``dylan`` library's
``dylan`` module.
