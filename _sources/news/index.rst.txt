New website
===========

**2023-07-07** - The opendylan.org website has had a long overdue major
overhaul. The goals of this revamp were:

1. Better navigation. For example, when reading documentation in the Library
   Reference it should be easy to navigate to the Hacker Guide or package
   docs. Now everything is accessible from the left sidebar.

#. Better accessibility. The old site had a very low contrast top navbar and
   other low contrast elements. The new `Furo
   <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_ theme has much better contrast
   plus light and dark themes.

#. Local table of contents in the right sidebar. Hooray `Furo
   <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_!

#. Integrated :doc:`package docs <../package/index>`.

#. Simplicity! We're a small team so we want to avoid any extra maintenance
   burden. To that end, we no longer use a Dylan-specific Sphinx theme or
   templates. If it ain't in `Furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_,
   we don't want it! :-)

We'd love to hear feedback on the new site. You can `file a bug
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/website/issues>`_ or `drop us a note on Matrix
<https://app.element.io/#/room/#dylan-language:matrix.org>`_.
