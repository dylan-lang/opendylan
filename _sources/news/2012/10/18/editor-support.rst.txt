Improving Editor Support
========================

We have recently fixed some bugs in the syntax highlighting
support for Textmate and Sublime Text as well as for vim.

Sublime Text and Textmate
-------------------------

   Syntax highligting in Sublime Text

Textmate and Sublime Text used the same plugin which can
be found on GitHub at https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan.tmbundle.

* Using Open Dylan specific modifiers (``dynamic``, ``sideways``, etc)
  won't break the highlighting.
* ``locked`` and ``thread`` variable definitions are highlighted
  correctly now.
* Keyword / header highlighting at the start of a file is improved.

Also, we've submitted a request for this plugin to be made
available via Package Control for Sublime Text and hope
that this is ready in the near future.

Vim

   Syntax highlighting in vim

We extended the Dylan support of vim:

* Improved comment handling such that all comments should
  be highlighted correctly now.
* Improved operator highlighting.
* Enabled spell checking for strings, comments and headers.
  To see this, you can toggle ``:set spell`` in vim.
* Enabled highlighting for the built-in functions as defined
  in the DRM.

The files for vim can be found in https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-vim.

Patches and further improvements are welcome!
