New command-line-parser Library
===============================

The `command-line-parser
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/command-line-parser>`_ library has been
completely rewritten to

  * be far less verbose
  * have simplified usage
  * have automatic support for --help
  * be `documented </library-reference/command-line-parser/index.html>`_

Testworks and the HTTP server are using the new library.  More
enhancements coming soon.
