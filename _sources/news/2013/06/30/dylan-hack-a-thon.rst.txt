Dylan Hack-a-thon: July 13-14, 2013
===================================

We are hosting our first online hack-a-thon in many
years on July 13-14, 2013.

No matter if you know Dylan or not, we can help you
`learn Dylan`_ or put your other skills to use. We've
got a good `list of tasks`_ that we're collecting
and some people will bring their own Dylan-related
projects. If you're a complete newcomer to Dylan,
we're willing to help you get a build installed and
get started.

If you're interested and have some questions or would
just like to let us know that you're coming, feel
free to `contact us on IRC or via email`_.

We are currently expecting attendees from North America,
Europe, South East Asia and perhaps New Zealand.

We look forward to seeing you there!
