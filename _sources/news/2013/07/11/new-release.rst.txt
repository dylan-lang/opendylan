Open Dylan 2013.1 released
==========================

Dear Dylan Hacker,

It is a pleasure for us to announce a new release of Open Dylan.

We have extensive `release notes </release-notes/2013.1.html>`_,
but this release has been about iterative improvement rather than major changes.

* A deadlock when using threads on x86-linux has been addressed.
* A crash when using threads on x86-linux has also been addressed.
* A crash from memory corruption on Mac OS X has been fixed.
* Some errors in how the Windows Registry was used have been corrected.
* There have been significant improvements to the documentation.
* A licensing issue with an unacknowledged copyright has been corrected.

Please report problems that you have in our `issue tracker <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues>`_.

You can get it from our website, `https://opendylan.org/download/ <https://opendylan.org/download/>`_.
On Windows there is an installer, on UNIX systems unpack into ``/opt``.
On 64 bit Linux, you will need to have the Boehm GC installed for our
executables to run. (Ubuntu: ``apt-get install libgc``)

Also, remember that this weekend, July 13-14 is our `hack-a-thon`_ and we hope that you'll consider participating.
You may also sign up for the hack-a-thon at our `Google Plus event page`_.

Good luck and happy Dylan hacking!
