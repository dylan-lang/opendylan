Dylan Programming Guide
=======================

The `Dylan Programming Guide`_ has been updated to
use our new documentation format.  As a result it is
now available in `PDF`_ and `ePub`_ formats as well
as much improved HTML.

The Dylan Programming Guide is a great introduction
to programming in Dylan and was written by Neil
Feinberg, Sonya E. Keene, Robert O. Matthews, and
P. Tucker Withington while they were employed by
Harlequin in the 1990s.  The book covers everything
from the basics up through advanced concepts such as
Dylan macros and the condition system.

This was exported from the 1996-era Framemaker files
and largely reformatted by hand.  During this work,
we also rewrote the lexer used in `Pygments`_ for
processing and syntax highlighting Dylan source code.
This new lexer will be available in the upcoming
Pygments 1.6.

In the future, we will add some errata to the book to
address some of the changes that have happened since
the book was originally published.

We hope that this will be helpful in introducing a
new generation of programmers to the Dylan programming
language.
