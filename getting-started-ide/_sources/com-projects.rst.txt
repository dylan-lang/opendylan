*********************
Creating COM Projects
*********************

Working with COM type libraries
===============================

Microsoft COM interfaces and implementations of those interfaces are
described on disk by *type libraries*. Type libraries can reside in
stand-alone files with the extension .TLB, or within files containing
executable code such as .DLL, .EXE, and .OCX files. Often the file that
implements a COM component also contains the type library representing
that component.

Open Dylan includes a tool that can read the contents of a type
library and generate Dylan code to act as a client to the COM interfaces
and classes the type library describes, or to act as a server
implementing the type library's interfaces and classes.

You can invoke this type library tool from a Open Dylan project by
including a *specification file* in the project. A specification file
describes what type library to translate and in what way the translation
will be used. Specification files have the extension .SPEC. You can find
more details about specification files in section `The type library
tool and specification files`_.

To make using the tool easier, the New Project wizard allows you to
create a project containing a specification file.

An example COM server and client
================================

The following example explains how the type library tool works and how
to use the New Project wizard features that support it.

In the example, we will create COM server and client applications. We
will write a simple encryption engine as a COM server, and write a
simple client to that interface. In order to make things simpler, we
have provided a COM type library describing the encryption interface.

Creating the server stubs library
---------------------------------

First we use the New Project wizard to create a Dylan library defining
server-side stubs for the encryption interface.

Choose **File > New…** from the main window.

#. Select **Project** and click **OK**.

The New Project wizard appears.

#. In the Project Type section, select "Interface to COM Type Library"
   and click **Next**.

The next page allows you to name a type library to be translated. Most
COM components store the location of their type libraries in the Windows
Registry. These registered type libraries are listed in the Installed
Type Libraries section of the window. You can select a type library from
the list, or click **Browse…** in the Location pane to select a type
library file from disk.

.. figure:: images/motwiz.png
   :align: center

   Choosing a type library file to convert.

In this case, we use a type library supplied with Open Dylan.

#. Click **Browse…** and navigate to the Open Dylan examples folder.

The folder required is called Examples and is placed under the top-level
Open Dylan folder.

It is usually *C:\\Program Files\\Open Dylan\\Examples*.

#. Go to the *Documentation\\RotNExample* subfolder and choose the
   *RotNExample.tlb* file.
#. Click **Next** to continue to the next page of the wizard.

.. figure:: images/motstub.png
   :align: center

   Choosing the kind of skeleton code to generate.

The next page allows you to choose what kind of stubs to generate from
the type library. There are two options:

Dispatch client interfaces

-  Defines Dylan code to allow you to interface to COM servers.

Dispatch server skeletons

-  Defines Dylan code to allow you to create COM servers implementing
   the interfaces described in the type library.

Because we are writing the server side of the application, we want to
generate dispatch server skeleton code.

#. Select "Dispatch server skeletons".
#. Click **Next** to continue to the next page of the wizard.

.. figure:: images/motinters.png
   :align: center

   Choosing interfaces and classes from the type library.

The next page presents a list of COM classes and interfaces contained in
the selected type library. You can select which to translate by choosing
"Translate selected" and then clicking to select individual items,
dragging or using the Shift key to select ranges, and using the Ctrl key
to select additional items. Choose "Translate all" and all classes and
interfaces in the type library will be translated. This is different
from selecting all items under "Translate selected" because if classes
or interfaces are added to the type library later, they will only be
translated if you selected "Translate all".

#. Choose "Translate all", so that both the RotNExample COM class and
   the IRotNExample interface are translated.
#. Click **Next**.

Now we reach the Project Name and Location page. This and all subsequent
pages are the same as those that you see for other kinds of project in
the New Project wizard. Follow the remaining steps to finish defining
the server stubs project.

#. Change the name of the project to *RotNExample-server-stubs*.
#. Choose a suitable Location for the project.
#. Make sure that the "Dynamic Link Library (DLL)" option is chosen in
   the Project Settings and Templates section.
#. Make sure that the "Include any available templates" option is *not*
   checked.
#. Click **Next** to continue.

We are now at the Use Libraries page. We are only defining the stubs for
the server, so we do not need any unusual libraries.

#. Choose the "Minimal" option.
#. Click **Next** to continue.

We are now at the final page of the New Project wizard.

#. Make any changes you want to the Source File Headers section.
#. Click **Finish**.

The new project appears.

.. figure:: images/motproj.png
   :align: center

   The server stubs project.

In addition to the usual files, this project contains a file named
*type-library.spec*. This is a specification file. It provides
information to the type library tool.

#. Double-click on the specification file.

An editor window opens on the specification file.

The specification file looks something like this:

.. code-block:: dylan

    Origin: COM-type-library
    Type-library: C:\\Program Files\\Open Dylan\\Examples\\…\\RotNExample.tlb
    Module: type-library-module
    Module-file: type-library-module.dylan
    Generate: dispatch-servers
    Stub-file: stubs.dylan

As you can see, the specification file contains all the information
provided to the type library portion of the New Project wizard.

However, no skeleton code has yet been generated. The type library tool,
which generates the skeleton code, only runs when you build the project.

#. Build the project with **Project > Build**.

The build process adds some new files to the project. These files were
generated by the type library tool.

The file *type-library-module.dylan* defines a module in which the
translated code resides. This module exports all translated symbols. If
you look at *module.dylan*, you will see that the main module
re-exports all of these symbols.

The file *stubs.dylan* contains the Dylan code generated by the type
library tool. It defines a class for an implementation of the
IRotNExample interface, and generic functions for the methods and
properties of the interface:

.. code-block:: dylan

    /* Dispatch interface: IRotNExample version 0.0
     * GUID: {822ED42A-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}
     * Description: An example interface for Open Dylan's Getting
     * Started manual. */

    define open dispatch-interface <IRotNExample> (<simple-dispatch>)
      uuid "{822ED42A-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}";
      virtual property IRotNExample/key :: type-union(<integer>,
        <machine-word>), name: "key", disp-id: 12288;
      function IRotNExample/encrypt (arg-pre :: <string>) =>
        (arg-result :: <string>), name: "encrypt", disp-id: 24576;
      function IRotNExample/decrypt (arg-pre :: <string>) =>
        (arg-result :: <string>), name: "decrypt", disp-id: 24577;
    end dispatch-interface <IRotNExample>;
    define open generic IRotNExample/key (this :: <IRotNExample>) =>
      (arg-result :: type-union(<integer>, <machine-word>));
    define open generic IRotNExample/key-setter (arg-result ::
      type-union(<integer>, <machine-word>), this :: <IRotNExample>)
      => (arg-result :: type-union(<integer>, <machine-word>));
    define open generic IRotNExample/encrypt (this :: <IRotNExample>,
      arg-pre :: <string>) => (result :: <HRESULT>, arg-result ::
      <string>);
    define open generic IRotNExample/decrypt (this :: <IRotNExample>,
      arg-pre :: <string>) => (result :: <HRESULT>, arg-result ::
      <string>);

This defines a class ``<IRotNExample>`` which implements the given
interface. The implementation is not complete until methods are provided
for the generics. This can be done by adding methods in the same
library, or by defining a subclass of ``<IRotNExample>`` in another
library and defining methods on the subclass. We will take the latter
approach.

There is also generated code corresponding to the COM class RotNExample
from the type library:

.. code-block:: dylan

    /* COM class: RotNExample version 0.0
     * GUID: {C44502DB-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}
     * Description: Implementation of IRotNExample.
     */

    define constant $RotNExample-class-id = as(<REFCLSID>,
                                               "{C44502DB-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}");
    /* You should define your coclass something like this:
    define coclass $RotNExample-type-info
      name "RotNExample";
      uuid $RotNExample-class-id;
      default interface <IRotNExample>;
    end coclass;
    */

Note that the ``define coclass`` is within a comment, since you may want
to define a COM class based on a subclass of ``<IRotNExample>``.

Creating the server
-------------------

Now we create the actual server application.

Choose **File > New…** from the main window.

#. Select *Project* and click **OK**.

The New Project wizard appears.

#. In the Project Type section, select "GUI Application (EXE)" and click
   **Next**.
#. Name the project *RotNExample-server*.
#. Make sure that the "Include any available templates" option is *not*
   checked.
#. Make sure that "Production mode" is selected in the Compilation Mode
   section of the Advanced Project Settings dialog.

This option will be set already if you have been following all steps
from the start of this chapter.

#. Click **Next** to continue.
#. Choose the "Simple" libraries option and click **Next** to continue.
#. Choose the "Standard IO streams and string formatting" option from
   "IO and system support", and click **Next**.
#. Choose the "Win32 API" option from "GUI support", and click **Next**.
#. Choose the "OLE Automation" option from "OLE Automation support" and
   click **Next**.
#. Choose the "NoneY" option from "Database support" and click **Next**.
#. Click **Finish**.

The RotNExample-server project window appears.

#. In the new project's window, edit *library.dylan*, and add to the
   ``define library`` declaration the following line:

.. code-block:: dylan

    use RotNExample-server-stubs;

#. Add the same line to the ``define module`` declaration in
   *module.dylan*.

To implement the IRotNExample interface, we will create a subclass of
``<IRotNExample>``. Because ``<IRotNExample>`` was created with ``define
dispatch-interface``, we must use ``define COM-interface`` to create
the subclass.

.. note:: The remainder of this section of the example involves adding
   code to *RotNExample-server.dylan*. A version of this file with all the
   code we add in this section is available in the Open Dylan
   installation folder, under
   *Examples\\Documentation\\RotNExample\\RotNExample-server.dylan*. You
   may want to copy that file into place in your project folder rather than
   typing code in.

#. Add the following code to *RotNExample-server.dylan*.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define COM-interface <IRotN-implementation> (<IRotNExample>)
      slot IRotNExample/key ::
      type-union(<integer>, <machine-word>) = 13;
    end;

If you add this by hand, make sure not to put it after the top-level
call to *main*.

We provide here an implementation for the *IRotNExample/key* slot, which
was defined as a virtual slot in the superclass. This slot must accept
the ``<machine-word>`` type, since any 32-bit integer which does not fit
in the range of a Dylan :drm:`<integer>` will be passed as a
``<machine-word>``.

The next task is to define the *IRotNExample/encrypt* and
*IRotNExample/decrypt* methods. Although it is not obvious from the
definition of ``<IRotNExample>``, these methods must take as their first
parameter the instance of ``<IRotN-implementation>`` they operate on, and
return as a first result a COM error code.

#. Add the following code to *RotNExample-server.dylan*.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method IRotNExample/encrypt
      (this :: <IRotN-implementation>, pre :: <string>)
    => (result :: <HRESULT>, post :: <string>)
      if (instance?(this.IRotNExample/key, <integer>))
        let post = make(<string>, size: pre.size);
        for (char keyed-by index in pre)
          post[index] := rot-char-by-n(char, this.IRotNExample/key);
        end for;
        values($S-OK, post)
      else
        values($E-INVALIDARG, "")
      end if
    end;

    define method IRotNExample/decrypt
      (this :: <IRotN-implementation>, pre :: <string>)
    => (result :: <HRESULT>, post :: <string>)
      if (instance?(this.IRotNExample/key, <integer>))
        let post = make(<string>, size: pre.size);
        for (char keyed-by index in pre)
          post[index] := rot-char-by-n(char, -this.IRotNExample/key);
        end for;
        values($S-OK, post)
      else
        values($E-INVALIDARG, "")
      end if
    end;

Note that this code is careful not to crash when *IRotNExample/key* is a
``<machine-word>``. ``$S-OK`` represents success. ``$E-INVALIDARG`` is a
generic failure representing some kind of invalid argument value.

The above method uses the *rot-char-by-n* function, which we must also
add.

#. Add the following code to *RotNExample-server.dylan*.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define function rot-char-by-n
      (char :: <character>, n :: <integer>)
    => (r :: <character>)
      let char-as-int = as(<integer>, char);
      local method rot-if-in-range
        (lower :: <integer>, upper :: <integer>) => ()
        if (lower <= char-as-int & char-as-int <= upper)
          char-as-int := lower + modulo(char-as-int - lower + n,
                                        upper - lower + 1);
        end if;
      end method;
      rot-if-in-range(as(<integer>, 'a'), as(<integer>, 'z'));
      rot-if-in-range(as(<integer>, 'A'), as(<integer>, 'Z'));
      as(<character>, char-as-int)
    end;

This function rotates alphabetic characters forward *n* positions,
wrapping around if the character passes "Z". When *n* is 13, this
implements the classic Rot13 cipher often used to hide offensive
material on USENET.

In order to create our server, we must also create a COM class for it.

#. Add the following code to *RotNExample-server.dylan*.

You may want to copy the ``define coclass`` code from *stubs.dylan* in
the *RotNExample-server-stubs* project and modify it.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define coclass $RotNExample-type-info
      name "RotNExample";
      uuid $RotNExample-class-id;
      default interface <IRotN-implementation>;
    end coclass;

Now we simply have to add a Windows event loop as the main body of the
server program.

#. Modify the ``main`` method in *RotNExample-server.dylan* to look like
   the following.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method main () => ()
      if (OLE-util-register-only?())
        register-coclass($RotNExample-type-info,
                         "Harlequin.RotNExample");
      else
        let factory :: <class-factory>
          = make-object-factory($RotNExample-type-info);
        with-stack-structure (pmsg :: <PMSG>)
          while (GetMessage(pmsg, $NULL-HWND, 0, 0))
            TranslateMessage(pmsg);
            DispatchMessage(pmsg);
          end while;
        end with-stack-structure;
        revoke-registration(factory);
      end if;
    end method main;

With this code in place, if the server is invoked from the command line
with */RegServer* as an argument, ``OLE-util-register-only?`` will return
``#t``. The call to ``register-coclass`` creates a type library (with
extension .TLB) and registers the type library and the server itself in
the Windows registry.

Note that the server provides no way to exit. We can make it exit
whenever our interface object is destroyed. This is a little simplistic,
since it does not correctly handle the case in which two servers are
created, but it will suffice for our example.

#. Add the following code to *RotNExample-server.dylan*.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method terminate (this :: <IRotN-implementation>) => ()
      next-method();
      PostQuitMessage(0); // Cause main event loop to terminate.
    end;

The ``PostQuitMessage`` call causes the next call to ``GetMessage`` (in
the main event loop) to return ``#f``, and thus cause the program to exit.

#. Build the project with **Project > Build**.

During the build, you will be prompted for the location of the project
file *RotNExample-server-stubs.hdp*.

Creating the client stubs library
---------------------------------

Now we create a project for the client-side stubs of the encryption
interface.

Choose **File > New…** from the main window.

#. Select **Project** and click **OK**.

The New Project wizard appears.

#. In the Project Type section, select "Interface to COM Type Library"
   and click **Next**.
#. Click **Browse…** and navigate to the Open Dylan examples folder.

The folder required is called Examples and is placed under the top-level
Open Dylan folder.

It is usually *C:\\Program Files\\Open Dylan\\Examples*.

#. Go to the *Documentation\\RotNExample* subfolder and choose the
   *RotNExample.tlb* file.
#. Click **Next** to continue to the next page of the wizard.
#. Select "Dispatch client interfaces" and click **Next** to continue to
   the next page of the wizard.
#. Choose "Translate all" on the next page, so that both the RotNExample
   COM class and the IRotNExample interface are translated. Click **Next**.
#. Change the name of the project to *RotNExample-client-stubs*.
#. Choose a suitable Location for the project.
#. Make sure that the "Dynamic Link Library (DLL)" option is chosen in
   the Project Settings and Templates section.
#. Make sure that the "Include any available templates" option is *not*
   chosen.
#. Click **Next** to continue.

We are now at the Use Libraries page. We are only defining the stubs for
the client, so we do not need any unusual libraries.

#. Choose the "Simple" option and click **Next**.
#. Choose the "Standard IO streams and string formatting" option from
   "IO and system support", and click **Next**.
#. Choose the "Win32 API" option from "GUI support", and click **Next**.

Note that the "OLE Automation" option on the "OLE Automation support"
page is automatically selected. That is what we want.

#. Click **Next**.
#. Choose the "NoneÝ" option from "Database support" and click **Next**.

We are now at the final page of the New Project wizard.

#. Make any changes you want to the Source File Headers section.
#. Click **Finish**.

The new project appears.

As with the server stubs project, we have to build this project to make
the type library tool run.

#. Build the project with **Project > Build**.

As before, files are added to the project. The
*type-library-module.dylan* file serves the same purpose as with the
server stubs. The difference is that *stubs.dylan* contains different
code. It defines a dispatch-client class for the *IRotNExample*
interface:

.. code-block:: dylan

    /* Dispatch interface: IRotNExample version 0.0
     * GUID: {822ED42A-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}
     * Description: An example interface for Open Dylan's
     * Getting Started manual.
     */

    define dispatch-client <IRotNExample>
      uuid "{822ED42A-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}";
      property IRotNExample/key :: type-union(<integer>, <machine-word>), name: "key",
      disp-id: 12288;
      function IRotNExample/encrypt (arg-pre :: <string>) =>
        (arg-result :: <string>), name: "encrypt", disp-id: 24576;
      function IRotNExample/decrypt (arg-pre :: <string>) =>
        (arg-result :: <string>), name: "decrypt", disp-id: 24577;
    end dispatch-client <IRotNExample>;

This defines a class ``<IRotNExample>`` which allows a client to use the
described interface.

There is also generated code corresponding to the COM class RotNExample
from the type library:

.. code-block:: dylan

    /* COM class: RotNExample version 0.0
     * GUID: {C44502DB-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}
     * Description: Implementation of IRotNExample.
     */

    define constant $RotNExample-class-id =
      as(<REFCLSID>, "{C44502DB-3EB1-11D2-A3CA-0060B0572A7F}");
    define function make-RotNExample ()
    => (default-interface :: <IRotNExample>)
      let default-interface = make(<IRotNExample>,
                                   class-id: $RotNExample-class-id);
      values(default-interface)
    end function make-RotNExample;

This function creates an instance of the RotNExample COM class, and
returns its default (and only) interface.

Creating the client
-------------------

Now we create the actual client application.

Choose **File > New…** from the main window.

#. Select **Project** and click **OK**.

The New Project wizard appears.

#. In the Project Type section, select "Console Application (EXE)" and
   click **Next** to continue to the next wizard page.
#. Name the project *RotNExample-client*.
#. Choose a suitable Location for the project.
#. Make sure the "Include any available templates" option is *not*
   chosen.
#. Click **Next**.
#. Choose the Simple libraries option, and choose the "Standard IO
   streams and string formatting" and "OLE Automation" options.
#. Proceed to the last page of the wizard and click **Finish**.
#. In the new project, edit *library.dylan*, and add to the ``define
   library`` declaration the following line:

.. code-block:: dylan

    use RotNExample-client-stubs;

#. Add the same line to the ``define module`` declaration in
   *module.dylan*.

We now add code to make the client encrypt and decrypt a simple string
with the default key of 13 and with the key set to 3.

.. Note:: The remainder of this section of the example involves adding
   code to *RotNExample-client.dylan*. A version of this file with all the
   code we add in this section is available in the Open Dylan
   installation folder, under
   *Examples\\Documentation\\RotNExample\\RotNExample-client.dylan*. You
   may want to copy that file into place in your project folder rather than
   typing code in.

#. Modify the ``main`` method in *RotNExample-client.dylan* to look like
   the following.

.. code-block:: dylan

    define method main () => ()
      with-ole
        format-out("Client connecting to server.\\n");
        let server = make-RotNExample();
        local method encrypt-and-decrypt () => ()
          let plaintext = "And he was going ooo-la, oooooo-la...";
          format-out("Plaintext is %=, encrypting.\\n", plaintext);
          let ciphertext = IRotNExample/encrypt(server, plaintext);
          format-out("Ciphertext is %=, decrypting.\\n", ciphertext);
          let decrypted = IRotNExample/decrypt(server, ciphertext);
          format-out("Decrypted text is %=.\\n", decrypted);
        end method;
        encrypt-and-decrypt();
        server.IRotNExample/key := 3;
        format-out("Set key to %d.\\n", server.IRotNExample/key);
        encrypt-and-decrypt();
        format-out("Client releasing server.\\n");
        release(server);
      end with-ole;
    end method main;

The ``with-ole`` macro initializes OLE at entry and uninitializes it at
exit.

#. Build the project with **Project > Build**.

During the build, you will be prompted for the location of the project
file *RotNExample-client-stubs.hdp*.

Testing the client and server pair
----------------------------------

The best way to test the client and server pair is from within the
Open Dylan environment, so that we can use the debugger if either
application fails.

First we must register the server with the system, so that COM knows
where to find the server and what interfaces it supports. In order to do
this, we must execute the server with the */RegServer* command line
flag. This will cause the server's call ``OLE-util-register-only?`` to
return ``#t``, and the server to call ``register-coclass``.

Open the RotNExample-server project and build it.

#. Select *Project > Settings…* in the RotNExample-server project
   window.

The Project Settings dialog appears.

#. On the Debug page, put */RegServer* in the Arguments field, and click
   *OK*.
#. Start the RotNExample-server application.

The server application registers itself and exits immediately. You can
tell that the server has exited by watching the stop button in the
project window become unavailable.

Now that the server is registered, it can be invoked by the client. But
we are going to start the server manually in the environment before
starting the client. That way, if the server fails, we can debug it in
the environment.

First, however, we need to remove the */RegServer* argument from the
project settings, so that the server can run normally.

#. Select **Project > Settings…** in the RotNExample-server project
   window.

The Project Settings dialog appears.

#. On the Debug page, remove */RegServer* from the Arguments field, and
   click **OK**.
#. Start RotNExample-server.
#. Start RotNExample-client.

The client should execute, and print something like this::

    Client connecting to server.
    Plaintext is "And he was going ooo-la, oooooo-la...", encrypting.
    Ciphertext is "Naq ur jnf tbvat bbb-yn, bbbbbb-yn...",
    decrypting.
    Decrypted text is "And he was going ooo-la, oooooo-la...".
    Set key to 3.
    Plaintext is "And he was going ooo-la, oooooo-la...", encrypting.
    Ciphertext is "Dqg kh zdv jrlqj rrr-od, rrrrrr-od...",
    decrypting.
    Decrypted text is "And he was going ooo-la, oooooo-la...".
    Client releasing server.

Creating vtable and dual interfaces
===================================

The New Project wizard can generate custom (vtable) and dual (vtable and
dispatch) COM interfaces. They are available on the wizard's
stub-selection page, from the options "Custom (vtable) interfaces" and
"Dual interfaces".

Because custom and dual interfaces generate both server and client
interfaces, it is necessary to ensure that the names of the server and
client interfaces do not collide. Thus when either of these is selected
an additional page appears for specifying suffixes for the names of the
generated interfaces.

   Custom and dual interface class suffix selection.

The server class suffix is appended to the name of the interface when
generating the server class name. For example, if the server class
suffix is *-server* then the server class for an interface *IBar* is
named ``<IBar-server>``.

The supplied client class suffix is appended to the name of the
interface to generate the client class name. If the "Generate client
classes with suffix" box is not checked, no client classes are
generated, and client methods specialize on ``<C-Interface>`` instead.

The type library tool and specification files
=============================================

The type library tool is invoked any time you build a project which
includes a a type library tool specification, or .SPEC, file. This is a
text file, where the first line must be::

    Origin: COM-type-library

This line identifies that the type library tool should be used to
process the file. When it runs, the type library tool will regenerate
the module and stub files when they do not exist, or if the .SPEC file
has been modified more recently then the last build.

Type library tool specification files can contain the following
keywords:

**Type-library**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Type-library: *typelibrary-path*

    Required. Specifies the pathname of the type library to translate. If
    *typelibrary-path* is a relative path, it is considered to be relative
    to the location of the specification file.

**Module-file**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Module-file: *module-file-to-generate*

    Required. Specifies the pathname of the module file to generate. The
    file will be created, if necessary, and added to the project, if
    necessary.

**Module**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Module: *module-name-to-generate*

    Required. The name of the module definition to generate. This module
    definition is placed in the file *module-file-to-generate*.

**Stub-file**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Stub-file: *stub-file-to-generate*

    Required. Specifies the pathname of the Dylan source file to generate.
    This file will be created, if necessary, and added to the project, if
    necessary.

**Generate**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Generate: *type-of-stubs*

    Required. Determines what type of stubs are generated in the file
    specified using *Stub-file:*. Possible values of *type-of-stubs* are:

    *dispatch-clients*
        Dispatch client code is generated, using ``define dispatch-client``.

    *dispatch-servers*
        Dispatch server code is generated, using ``define
        dispatch-interface``.

    *vtable-interfaces*
        Custom (vtable) interfaces are generated, using ``define
        vtable-interface``. The names of server interfaces are affected by
        the value of *Server-suffix:* (below). The names of client interfaces
        and whether client interfaces are generated are affected by the
        presence and the value of *Client-suffix:* (below).

    *dual-interfaces*
        Dual (vtable and dispatch) interfaces are generated, using ``define
        vtable-interface``. The names of server interfaces are affected by
        the value of *Server-suffix:*. The names of client interfaces and
        whether client interfaces are generated are affected by the presence
        and the value of *Client-suffix:*.

**Server-suffix**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Server-suffix: *server-suffix*

    Optional. Only meaningful when *Generate:* 's *type-of-stubs* argument
    is *vtable-interfaces* or *dual-interfaces*. Specifies a suffix which
    is appended to generated server interface names. If no value is provided
    or the *Server-suffix:* keyword is omitted then no suffix is appended.

**Client-suffix**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Client-suffix: *client-suffix*

    Optional. Only meaningful when *Generate:* 's *type-of-stubs* argument
    is *vtable-interfaces* or *dual-interfaces*. Specifies a suffix which
    is appended to generated client interface names. If the *Client-suffix:*
    keyword is omitted then client classes are not generated (the
    client-class clause is not provided to the define vtable-interfaces or
    define dual-interfaces macro invocation). To generate client classes but
    not append a suffix, an empty value must be provided to the
    *Client-suffix:* keyword. For example::

        Client-suffix:

**Interfaces**:
    SPEC file keyword

    ::

        Interfaces: *interfaces-and-coclasses-to-translate*

    Optional. If provided, specifies the names of the interfaces and COM
    classes to translate. If not provided, all interfaces and COM classes
    are translated. All interfaces or COM classes after the first listed
    should be provided on a new line, preceded by a tab or spaces. For
    example::

        Interfaces: IInterfaceOne
                    InterfaceOneCoclass
                    IInterfaceTwo
                    InterfaceTwoCoclass
